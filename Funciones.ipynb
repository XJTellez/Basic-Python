Nathless all,\\nThat in my thoughts I of that sacred realm\\nCould store, shall now be matter of my song.\\n\\nBenign Apollo! this last labour aid,\\nAnd make me such a vessel of thy worth,\\nAs thy own laurel claims of me belov\\'d.\\nThus far hath one of steep Parnassus\\' brows\\nSuffic\\'d me; henceforth there is need of both\\nFor my remaining enterprise Do thou\\nEnter into my bosom, and there breathe\\nSo, as when Marsyas by thy hand was dragg\\'d\\nForth from his limbs unsheath\\'d.  O power divine!\\nIf thou to me of shine impart so much,\\nThat of that happy realm the shadow\\'d form\\nTrac\\'d in my thoughts I may set forth to view,\\nThou shalt behold me of thy favour\\'d tree\\nCome to the foot, and crown myself with leaves;\\nFor to that honour thou, and my high theme\\nWill fit me.  If but seldom, mighty Sire!\\nTo grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath\\nCaesar or bard (more shame for human wills\\nDeprav\\'d) joy to the Delphic god must spring\\nFrom the Pierian foliage, when one breast\\nIs with such thirst inspir\\'d.  From a small spark\\nGreat flame hath risen: after me perchance\\nOthers with better voice may pray, and gain\\nFrom the Cirrhaean city answer kind.\\n\\nThrough diver passages, the world\\'s bright lamp\\nRises to mortals, but through that which joins\\nFour circles with the threefold cross, in best\\nCourse, and in happiest constellation set\\nHe comes, and to the worldly wax best gives\\nIts temper and impression.  Morning there,\\nHere eve was by almost such passage made;\\nAnd whiteness had o\\'erspread that hemisphere,\\nBlackness the other part; when to the left\\nI saw Beatrice turn\\'d, and on the sun\\nGazing, as never eagle fix\\'d his ken.\\nAs from the first a second beam is wont\\nTo issue, and reflected upwards rise,\\nE\\'en as a pilgrim bent on his return,\\nSo of her act, that through the eyesight pass\\'d\\nInto my fancy, mine was form\\'d; and straight,\\nBeyond our mortal wont, I fix\\'d mine eyes\\nUpon the sun.  Much is allowed us there,\\nThat here exceeds our pow\\'r; thanks to the place\\nMade for the dwelling of the human kind\\n\\nI suffer\\'d it not long, and yet so long\\nThat I beheld it bick\\'ring sparks around,\\nAs iron that comes boiling from the fire.\\nAnd suddenly upon the day appear\\'d\\nA day new-ris\\'n, as he, who hath the power,\\nHad with another sun bedeck\\'d the sky.\\n\\nHer eyes fast fix\\'d on the eternal wheels,\\nBeatrice stood unmov\\'d; and I with ken\\nFix\\'d upon her, from upward gaze remov\\'d\\nAt her aspect, such inwardly became\\nAs Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb,\\nThat made him peer among the ocean gods;\\nWords may not tell of that transhuman change:\\nAnd therefore let the example serve, though weak,\\nFor those whom grace hath better proof in store\\n\\nIf I were only what thou didst create,\\nThen newly, Love! by whom the heav\\'n is rul\\'d,\\nThou know\\'st, who by thy light didst bear me up.\\nWhenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide,\\nDesired Spirit! with its harmony\\nTemper\\'d of thee and measur\\'d, charm\\'d mine ear,\\nThen seem\\'d to me so much of heav\\'n to blaze\\nWith the sun\\'s flame, that rain or flood ne\\'er made\\nA lake so broad.  The newness of the sound,\\nAnd that great light, inflam\\'d me with desire,\\nKeener than e\\'er was felt, to know their cause.\\n\\nWhence she who saw me, clearly as myself,\\nTo calm my troubled mind, before I ask\\'d,\\nOpen\\'d her lips, and gracious thus began:\\n\"With false imagination thou thyself\\nMak\\'st dull, so that thou seest not the thing,\\nWhich thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off.\\nThou art not on the earth as thou believ\\'st;\\nFor light\\'ning scap\\'d from its own proper place\\nNe\\'er ran, as thou hast hither now return\\'d.\"\\n\\nAlthough divested of my first-rais\\'d doubt,\\nBy those brief words, accompanied with smiles,\\nYet in new doubt was I entangled more,\\nAnd said: \"Already satisfied, I rest\\nFrom admiration deep, but now admire\\nHow I above those lighter bodies rise.\"\\n\\nWhence, after utt\\'rance of a piteous sigh,\\nShe tow\\'rds me bent her eyes, with such a look,\\nAs on her frenzied child a mother casts;\\nThen thus began: \"Among themselves all things\\nHave order; and from hence the form, which makes\\nThe universe resemble God.  In this\\nThe higher creatures see the printed steps\\nOf that eternal worth, which is the end\\nWhither the line is drawn.  All natures lean,\\nIn this their order, diversely, some more,\\nSome less approaching to their primal source.\\nThus they to different havens are mov\\'d on\\nThrough the vast sea of being, and each one\\nWith instinct giv\\'n, that bears it in its course;\\nThis to the lunar sphere directs the fire,\\nThis prompts the hearts of mortal animals,\\nThis the brute earth together knits, and binds.\\nNor only creatures, void of intellect,\\nAre aim\\'d at by this bow; but even those,\\nThat have intelligence and love, are pierc\\'d.\\nThat Providence, who so well orders all,\\nWith her own light makes ever calm the heaven,\\nIn which the substance, that hath greatest speed,\\nIs turn\\'d: and thither now, as to our seat\\nPredestin\\'d, we are carried by the force\\nOf that strong cord, that never looses dart,\\nBut at fair aim and glad.  Yet is it true,\\nThat as ofttimes but ill accords the form\\nTo the design of art, through sluggishness\\nOf unreplying matter, so this course\\nIs sometimes quitted by the creature, who\\nHath power, directed thus, to bend elsewhere;\\nAs from a cloud the fire is seen to fall,\\nFrom its original impulse warp\\'d, to earth,\\nBy vicious fondness.  Thou no more admire\\nThy soaring, (if I rightly deem,) than lapse\\nOf torrent downwards from a mountain\\'s height.\\nThere would in thee for wonder be more cause,\\nIf, free of hind\\'rance, thou hadst fix\\'d thyself\\nBelow, like fire unmoving on the earth.\"\\n\\nSo said, she turn\\'d toward the heav\\'n her face.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO II\\n\\nAll ye, who in small bark have following sail\\'d,\\nEager to listen, on the advent\\'rous track\\nOf my proud keel, that singing cuts its way,\\nBackward return with speed, and your own shores\\nRevisit, nor put out to open sea,\\nWhere losing me, perchance ye may remain\\nBewilder\\'d in deep maze.  The way I pass\\nNe\\'er yet was run: Minerva breathes the gale,\\nApollo guides me, and another Nine\\nTo my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal.\\nYe other few, who have outstretch\\'d the neck.\\nTimely for food of angels, on which here\\nThey live, yet never know satiety,\\nThrough the deep brine ye fearless may put out\\nYour vessel, marking, well the furrow broad\\nBefore you in the wave, that on both sides\\nEqual returns.  Those, glorious, who pass\\'d o\\'er\\nTo Colchos, wonder\\'d not as ye will do,\\nWhen they saw Jason following the plough.\\n\\nThe increate perpetual thirst, that draws\\nToward the realm of God\\'s own form, bore us\\nSwift almost as the heaven ye behold.\\n\\nBeatrice upward gaz\\'d, and I on her,\\nAnd in such space as on the notch a dart\\nIs plac\\'d, then loosen\\'d flies, I saw myself\\nArriv\\'d, where wond\\'rous thing engag\\'d my sight.\\nWhence she, to whom no work of mine was hid,\\nTurning to me, with aspect glad as fair,\\nBespake me: \"Gratefully direct thy mind\\nTo God, through whom to this first star we come.\"\\n\\nMe seem\\'d as if a cloud had cover\\'d us,\\nTranslucent, solid, firm, and polish\\'d bright,\\nLike adamant, which the sun\\'s beam had smit\\nWithin itself the ever-during pearl\\nReceiv\\'d us, as the wave a ray of light\\nReceives, and rests unbroken.  If I then\\nWas of corporeal frame, and it transcend\\nOur weaker thought, how one dimension thus\\nAnother could endure, which needs must be\\nIf body enter body, how much more\\nMust the desire inflame us to behold\\nThat essence, which discovers by what means\\nGod and our nature join\\'d!  There will be seen\\nThat which we hold through faith, not shown by proof,\\nBut in itself intelligibly plain,\\nE\\'en as the truth that man at first believes.\\n\\nI answered: \"Lady! I with thoughts devout,\\nSuch as I best can frame, give thanks to Him,\\nWho hath remov\\'d me from the mortal world.\\nBut tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots\\nUpon this body, which below on earth\\nGive rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?\"\\n\\nShe somewhat smil\\'d, then spake: \"If mortals err\\nIn their opinion, when the key of sense\\nUnlocks not, surely wonder\\'s weapon keen\\nOught not to pierce thee; since thou find\\'st, the wings\\nOf reason to pursue the senses\\' flight\\nAre short.  But what thy own thought is, declare.\"\\n\\nThen I: \"What various here above appears,\\nIs caus\\'d, I deem, by bodies dense or rare.\"\\n\\nShe then resum\\'d: \"Thou certainly wilt see\\nIn falsehood thy belief o\\'erwhelm\\'d, if well\\nThou listen to the arguments, which I\\nShall bring to face it.  The eighth sphere displays\\nNumberless lights, the which in kind and size\\nMay be remark\\'d of different aspects;\\nIf rare or dense of that were cause alone,\\nOne single virtue then would be in all,\\nAlike distributed, or more, or less.\\nDifferent virtues needs must be the fruits\\nOf formal principles, and these, save one,\\nWill by thy reasoning be destroy\\'d.  Beside,\\nIf rarity were of that dusk the cause,\\nWhich thou inquirest, either in some part\\nThat planet must throughout be void, nor fed\\nWith its own matter; or, as bodies share\\nTheir fat and leanness, in like manner this\\nMust in its volume change the leaves.  The first,\\nIf it were true, had through the sun\\'s eclipse\\nBeen manifested, by transparency\\nOf light, as through aught rare beside effus\\'d.\\nBut this is not.  Therefore remains to see\\nThe other cause: and if the other fall,\\nErroneous so must prove what seem\\'d to thee.\\nIf not from side to side this rarity\\nPass through, there needs must be a limit, whence\\nIts contrary no further lets it pass.\\nAnd hence the beam, that from without proceeds,\\nMust be pour\\'d back, as colour comes, through glass\\nReflected, which behind it lead conceals.\\nNow wilt thou say, that there of murkier hue\\nThan in the other part the ray is shown,\\nBy being thence refracted farther back.\\nFrom this perplexity will free thee soon\\nExperience, if thereof thou trial make,\\nThe fountain whence your arts derive their streame.\\nThree mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove\\nFrom thee alike, and more remote the third.\\nBetwixt the former pair, shall meet thine eyes;\\nThen turn\\'d toward them, cause behind thy back\\nA light to stand, that on the three shall shine,\\nAnd thus reflected come to thee from all.\\nThough that beheld most distant do not stretch\\nA space so ample, yet in brightness thou\\nWill own it equaling the rest.  But now,\\nAs under snow the ground, if the warm ray\\nSmites it, remains dismantled of the hue\\nAnd cold, that cover\\'d it before, so thee,\\nDismantled in thy mind, I will inform\\nWith light so lively, that the tremulous beam\\nShall quiver where it falls.  Within the heaven,\\nWhere peace divine inhabits, circles round\\nA body, in whose virtue dies the being\\nOf all that it contains.  The following heaven,\\nThat hath so many lights, this being divides,\\nThrough  different essences, from it distinct,\\nAnd yet contain\\'d within it.  The other orbs\\nTheir separate distinctions variously\\nDispose, for their own seed and produce apt.\\nThus do these organs of the world proceed,\\nAs thou beholdest now, from step to step,\\nTheir influences from above deriving,\\nAnd thence transmitting downwards.  Mark me well,\\nHow through this passage to the truth I ford,\\nThe truth thou lov\\'st, that thou henceforth alone,\\nMay\\'st know to keep the shallows, safe, untold.\\n\\n\"The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs,\\nAs mallet by the workman\\'s hand, must needs\\nBy blessed movers be inspir\\'d.  This heaven,\\nMade beauteous by so many luminaries,\\nFrom the deep spirit, that moves its circling sphere,\\nIts image takes an impress as a seal:\\nAnd as the soul, that dwells within your dust,\\nThrough members different, yet together form\\'d,\\nIn different pow\\'rs resolves itself; e\\'en so\\nThe intellectual efficacy unfolds\\nIts goodness multiplied throughout the stars;\\nOn its own unity revolving still.\\nDifferent virtue compact different\\nMakes with the precious body it enlivens,\\nWith which it knits, as life in you is knit.\\nFrom its original nature full of joy,\\nThe virtue mingled through the body shines,\\nAs joy through pupil of the living eye.\\nFrom hence proceeds, that which from light to light\\nSeems different, and not from dense or rare.\\nThis is the formal cause, that generates\\nProportion\\'d to its power, the dusk or clear.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO III\\n\\nThat sun, which erst with love my bosom warm\\'d\\nHad of fair truth unveil\\'d the sweet aspect,\\nBy proof of right, and of the false reproof;\\nAnd I, to own myself convinc\\'d and free\\nOf doubt, as much as needed, rais\\'d my head\\nErect for speech.  But soon a sight appear\\'d,\\nWhich, so intent to mark it, held me fix\\'d,\\nThat of confession I no longer thought.\\n\\nAs through translucent and smooth glass, or wave\\nClear and unmov\\'d, and flowing not so deep\\nAs that its bed is dark, the shape returns\\nSo faint of our impictur\\'d lineaments,\\nThat on white forehead set a pearl as strong\\nComes to the eye: such saw I many a face,\\nAll stretch\\'d to speak, from whence I straight conceiv\\'d\\nDelusion opposite to that, which rais\\'d\\nBetween the man and fountain, amorous flame.\\n\\nSudden, as I perceiv\\'d them, deeming these\\nReflected semblances to see of whom\\nThey were, I turn\\'d mine eyes, and nothing saw;\\nThen turn\\'d them back, directed on the light\\nOf my sweet guide, who smiling shot forth beams\\nFrom her celestial eyes.  \"Wonder not thou,\"\\nShe cry\\'d, \"at this my smiling, when I see\\nThy childish judgment; since not yet on truth\\nIt rests the foot, but, as it still is wont,\\nMakes thee fall back in unsound vacancy.\\nTrue substances are these, which thou behold\\'st,\\nHither through failure of their vow exil\\'d.\\nBut speak thou with them; listen, and believe,\\nThat the true light, which fills them with desire,\\nPermits not from its beams their feet to stray.\"\\n\\nStraight to the shadow which for converse seem\\'d\\nMost earnest, I addressed me, and began,\\nAs one by over-eagerness perplex\\'d:\\n\"O spirit, born for joy! who in the rays\\nOf life eternal, of that sweetness know\\'st\\nThe flavour, which, not tasted, passes far\\nAll apprehension, me it well would please,\\nIf thou wouldst tell me of thy name, and this\\nYour station here.\" Whence she, with kindness prompt,\\nAnd eyes glist\\'ning with smiles: \"Our charity,\\nTo any wish by justice introduc\\'d,\\nBars not the door, no more than she above,\\nWho would have all her court be like herself.\\nI was a virgin sister in the earth;\\nAnd if thy mind observe me well, this form,\\nWith such addition grac\\'d of loveliness,\\nWill not conceal me long, but thou wilt know\\nPiccarda, in the tardiest sphere thus plac\\'d,\\nHere \\'mid these other blessed also blest.\\nOur hearts, whose high affections burn alone\\nWith pleasure, from the Holy Spirit conceiv\\'d,\\nAdmitted to his order dwell in joy.\\nAnd this condition, which appears so low,\\nIs for this cause assign\\'d us, that our vows\\nWere in some part neglected and made void.\"\\n\\nWhence I to her replied: \"Something divine\\nBeams in your countenance, wond\\'rous fair,\\nFrom former knowledge quite transmuting you.\\nTherefore to recollect was I so slow.\\nBut what thou sayst hath to my memory\\nGiven now such aid, that to retrace your forms\\nIs easier.  Yet inform me, ye, who here\\nAre happy, long ye for a higher place\\nMore to behold, and more in love to dwell?\"\\n\\nShe with those other spirits gently smil\\'d,\\nThen answer\\'d with such gladness, that she seem\\'d\\nWith love\\'s first flame to glow: \"Brother! our will\\nIs in composure settled by the power\\nOf charity, who makes us will alone\\nWhat we possess, and nought beyond desire;\\nIf we should wish to be exalted more,\\nThen must our wishes jar with the high will\\nOf him, who sets us here, which in these orbs\\nThou wilt confess not possible, if here\\nTo be in charity must needs befall,\\nAnd if her nature well thou contemplate.\\nRather it is inherent in this state\\nOf blessedness, to keep ourselves within\\nThe divine will, by which our wills with his\\nAre one.  So that as we from step to step\\nAre plac\\'d throughout this kingdom, pleases all,\\nE\\'en as our King, who in us plants his will;\\nAnd in his will is our tranquillity;\\nIt is the mighty ocean, whither tends\\nWhatever it creates and nature makes.\"\\n\\nThen saw I clearly how each spot in heav\\'n\\nIs Paradise, though with like gracious dew\\nThe supreme virtue show\\'r not over all.\\n\\nBut as it chances, if one sort of food\\nHath satiated, and of another still\\nThe appetite remains, that this is ask\\'d,\\nAnd thanks for that return\\'d; e\\'en so did I\\nIn word and motion, bent from her to learn\\nWhat web it was, through which she had not drawn\\nThe shuttle to its point.  She thus began:\\n\"Exalted worth and perfectness of life\\nThe Lady higher up enshrine in heaven,\\nBy whose pure laws upon your nether earth\\nThe robe and veil they wear, to that intent,\\nThat e\\'en till death they may keep watch or sleep\\nWith their great bridegroom, who accepts each vow,\\nWhich to his gracious pleasure love conforms.\\nfrom the world, to follow her, when young\\nEscap\\'d; and, in her vesture mantling me,\\nMade promise of the way her sect enjoins.\\nThereafter men, for ill than good more apt,\\nForth snatch\\'d me from the pleasant cloister\\'s pale.\\nGod knows how after that my life was fram\\'d.\\nThis other splendid shape, which thou beholdst\\nAt my right side, burning with all the light\\nOf this our orb, what of myself I tell\\nMay to herself apply.  From her, like me\\nA sister, with like violence were torn\\nThe saintly folds, that shaded her fair brows.\\nE\\'en when she to the world again was brought\\nIn spite of her own will and better wont,\\nYet not for that the bosom\\'s inward veil\\nDid she renounce.  This is the luminary\\nOf mighty Constance, who from that loud blast,\\nWhich blew the second over Suabia\\'s realm,\\nThat power produc\\'d, which was the third and last.\"\\n\\nShe ceas\\'d from further talk, and then began\\n\"Ave Maria\" singing, and with that song\\nVanish\\'d, as heavy substance through deep wave.\\n\\nMine eye, that far as it was capable,\\nPursued her, when in dimness she was lost,\\nTurn\\'d to the mark where greater want impell\\'d,\\nAnd bent on Beatrice all its gaze.\\nBut she as light\\'ning beam\\'d upon my looks:\\nSo that the sight sustain\\'d it not at first.\\nWhence I to question her became less prompt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO IV\\n\\nBetween two kinds of food, both equally\\nRemote and tempting, first a man might die\\nOf hunger, ere he one could freely choose.\\nE\\'en so would stand a lamb between the maw\\nOf two fierce wolves, in dread of both alike:\\nE\\'en so between two deer a dog would stand,\\nWherefore, if I was silent, fault nor praise\\nI to myself impute, by equal doubts\\nHeld in suspense, since of necessity\\nIt happen\\'d.  Silent was I, yet desire\\nWas painted in my looks; and thus I spake\\nMy wish more earnestly than language could.\\n\\nAs Daniel, when the haughty king he freed\\nFrom ire, that spurr\\'d him on to deeds unjust\\nAnd violent; so look\\'d Beatrice then.\\n\\n\"Well I discern,\" she thus her words address\\'d,\\n\"How contrary desires each way constrain thee,\\nSo that thy anxious thought is in itself\\nBound up and stifled, nor breathes freely forth.\\nThou arguest; if the good intent remain;\\nWhat reason that another\\'s violence\\nShould stint the measure of my fair desert?\\n\\n\"Cause too thou findst for doubt, in that it seems,\\nThat spirits to the stars, as Plato deem\\'d,\\nReturn.  These are the questions which thy will\\nUrge equally; and therefore I the first\\nOf that will treat which hath the more of gall.\\nOf seraphim he who is most ensky\\'d,\\nMoses and Samuel, and either John,\\nChoose which thou wilt, nor even Mary\\'s self,\\nHave not in any other heav\\'n their seats,\\nThan have those spirits which so late thou saw\\'st;\\nNor more or fewer years exist; but all\\nMake the first circle beauteous, diversely\\nPartaking of sweet life, as more or less\\nAfflation of eternal bliss pervades them.\\nHere were they shown thee, not that fate assigns\\nThis for their sphere, but for a sign to thee\\nOf that celestial furthest from the height.\\nThus needs, that ye may apprehend, we speak:\\nSince from things sensible alone ye learn\\nThat, which digested rightly after turns\\nTo intellectual.  For no other cause\\nThe scripture, condescending graciously\\nTo your perception, hands and feet to God\\nAttributes, nor so means: and holy church\\nDoth represent with human countenance\\nGabriel, and Michael, and him who made\\nTobias whole.  Unlike what here thou seest,\\nThe judgment of Timaeus, who affirms\\nEach soul restor\\'d to its particular star,\\nBelieving it to have been taken thence,\\nWhen nature gave it to inform her mold:\\nSince to appearance his intention is\\nE\\'en what his words declare: or else to shun\\nDerision, haply thus he hath disguis\\'d\\nHis true opinion.  If his meaning be,\\nThat to the influencing of these orbs revert\\nThe honour and the blame in human acts,\\nPerchance he doth not wholly miss the truth.\\nThis principle, not understood aright,\\nErewhile perverted well nigh all the world;\\nSo that it fell to fabled names of Jove,\\nAnd Mercury, and Mars.  That other doubt,\\nWhich moves thee, is less harmful; for it brings\\nNo peril of removing thee from me.\\n\\n\"That, to the eye of man, our justice seems\\nUnjust, is argument for faith, and not\\nFor heretic declension.  To the end\\nThis truth may stand more clearly in your view,\\nI will content thee even to thy wish\\n\\n\"If violence be, when that which suffers, nought\\nConsents to that which forceth, not for this\\nThese spirits stood exculpate.  For the will,\\nThat will not, still survives unquench\\'d, and doth\\nAs nature doth in fire, tho\\' violence\\nWrest it a thousand times; for, if it yield\\nOr more or less, so far it follows force.\\nAnd thus did these, whom they had power to seek\\nThe hallow\\'d place again.  In them, had will\\nBeen perfect, such as once upon the bars\\nHeld Laurence firm, or wrought in Scaevola\\nTo his own hand remorseless, to the path,\\nWhence they were drawn, their steps had hasten\\'d back,\\nWhen liberty return\\'d: but in too few\\nResolve so steadfast dwells.  And by these words\\nIf duly weigh\\'d, that argument is void,\\nWhich oft might have perplex\\'d thee still.  But now\\nAnother question thwarts thee, which to solve\\nMight try thy patience without better aid.\\nI have, no doubt, instill\\'d into thy mind,\\nThat blessed spirit may not lie; since near\\nThe source of primal truth it dwells for aye:\\nAnd thou might\\'st after of Piccarda learn\\nThat Constance held affection to the veil;\\nSo that she seems to contradict me here.\\nNot seldom, brother, it hath chanc\\'d for men\\nTo do what they had gladly left undone,\\nYet to shun peril they have done amiss:\\nE\\'en as Alcmaeon, at his father\\'s suit\\nSlew his own mother, so made pitiless\\nNot to lose pity.  On this point bethink thee,\\nThat force and will are blended in such wise\\nAs not to make the\\' offence excusable.\\nAbsolute will agrees not to the wrong,\\nThat inasmuch as there is fear of woe\\nFrom non-compliance, it agrees.  Of will\\nThus absolute Piccarda spake, and I\\nOf th\\' other; so that both have truly said.\"\\n\\nSuch was the flow of that pure rill, that well\\'d\\nFrom forth the fountain of all truth; and such\\nThe rest, that to my wond\\'ring thoughts I found.\\n\\n\"O thou of primal love the prime delight!\\nGoddess!\"  I straight reply\\'d, \"whose lively words\\nStill shed new heat and vigour through my soul!\\nAffection fails me to requite thy grace\\nWith equal sum of gratitude: be his\\nTo recompense, who sees and can reward thee.\\nWell I discern, that by that truth alone\\nEnlighten\\'d, beyond which no truth may roam,\\nOur mind can satisfy her thirst to know:\\nTherein she resteth, e\\'en as in his lair\\nThe wild beast, soon as she hath reach\\'d that bound,\\nAnd she hath power to reach it; else desire\\nWere given to no end.  And thence doth doubt\\nSpring, like a shoot, around the stock of truth;\\nAnd it is nature which from height to height\\nOn to the summit prompts us.  This invites,\\nThis doth assure me, lady, rev\\'rently\\nTo ask thee of other truth, that yet\\nIs dark to me.  I fain would know, if man\\nBy other works well done may so supply\\nThe failure of his vows, that in your scale\\nThey lack not weight.\"  I spake; and on me straight\\nBeatrice look\\'d with eyes that shot forth sparks\\nOf love celestial in such copious stream,\\nThat, virtue sinking in me overpower\\'d,\\nI turn\\'d, and downward bent confus\\'d my sight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO V\\n\\n\"If beyond earthly wont, the flame of love\\nIllume me, so that I o\\'ercome thy power\\nOf vision, marvel not: but learn the cause\\nIn that perfection of the sight, which soon\\nAs apprehending, hasteneth on to reach\\nThe good it apprehends.  I well discern,\\nHow in thine intellect already shines\\nThe light eternal, which to view alone\\nNe\\'er fails to kindle love; and if aught else\\nYour love seduces, \\'t is but that it shows\\nSome ill-mark\\'d vestige of that primal beam.\\n\\n\"This would\\'st thou know, if failure of the vow\\nBy other service may be so supplied,\\nAs from self-question to assure the soul.\"\\n\\nThus she her words, not heedless of my wish,\\nBegan; and thus, as one who breaks not off\\nDiscourse, continued in her saintly strain.\\n\"Supreme of gifts, which God creating gave\\nOf his free bounty, sign most evident\\nOf goodness, and in his account most priz\\'d,\\nWas liberty of will, the boon wherewith\\nAll intellectual creatures, and them sole\\nHe hath endow\\'d.  Hence now thou mayst infer\\nOf what high worth the vow, which so is fram\\'d\\nThat when man offers, God well-pleas\\'d accepts;\\nFor in the compact between God and him,\\nThis treasure, such as I describe it to thee,\\nHe makes the victim, and of his own act.\\nWhat compensation therefore may he find?\\nIf that, whereof thou hast oblation made,\\nBy using well thou think\\'st to consecrate,\\nThou would\\'st of theft do charitable deed.\\nThus I resolve thee of the greater point.\\n\\n\"But forasmuch as holy church, herein\\nDispensing, seems to contradict the truth\\nI have discover\\'d to thee, yet behooves\\nThou rest a little longer at the board,\\nEre the crude aliment, which thou hast taken,\\nDigested fitly to nutrition turn.\\nOpen thy mind to what I now unfold,\\nAnd give it inward keeping.  Knowledge comes\\nOf learning well retain\\'d, unfruitful else.\\n\\n\"This sacrifice in essence of two things\\nConsisteth; one is that, whereof \\'t is made,\\nThe covenant the other.  For the last,\\nIt ne\\'er is cancell\\'d if not kept: and hence\\nI spake erewhile so strictly of its force.\\nFor this it was enjoin\\'d the Israelites,\\nThough leave were giv\\'n them, as thou know\\'st, to change\\nThe offering, still to offer.  Th\\' other part,\\nThe matter and the substance of the vow,\\nMay well be such, to that without offence\\nIt may for other substance be exchang\\'d.\\nBut at his own discretion none may shift\\nThe burden on his shoulders, unreleas\\'d\\nBy either key, the yellow and the white.\\nNor deem of any change, as less than vain,\\nIf the last bond be not within the new\\nIncluded, as the quatre in the six.\\nNo satisfaction therefore can be paid\\nFor what so precious in the balance weighs,\\nThat all in counterpoise must kick the beam.\\nTake then no vow at random: ta\\'en, with faith\\nPreserve it; yet not bent, as Jephthah once,\\nBlindly to execute a rash resolve,\\nWhom better it had suited to exclaim,\\n\\'I have done ill,\\' than to redeem his pledge\\nBy doing worse or, not unlike to him\\nIn folly, that great leader of the Greeks:\\nWhence, on the alter, Iphigenia mourn\\'d\\nHer virgin beauty, and hath since made mourn\\nBoth wise and simple, even all, who hear\\nOf so fell sacrifice.  Be ye more staid,\\nO Christians, not, like feather, by each wind\\nRemovable: nor think to cleanse ourselves\\nIn every water.  Either testament,\\nThe old and new, is yours: and for your guide\\nThe shepherd of the church let this suffice\\nTo save you.  When by evil lust entic\\'d,\\nRemember ye be men, not senseless beasts;\\nNor let the Jew, who dwelleth in your streets,\\nHold you in mock\\'ry.  Be not, as the lamb,\\nThat, fickle wanton, leaves its mother\\'s milk,\\nTo dally with itself in idle play.\"\\n\\nSuch were the words that Beatrice spake:\\nThese ended, to that region, where the world\\nIs liveliest, full of fond desire she turn\\'d.\\n\\nThough mainly prompt new question to propose,\\nHer silence and chang\\'d look did keep me dumb.\\nAnd as the arrow, ere the cord is still,\\nLeapeth unto its mark; so on we sped\\nInto the second realm.  There I beheld\\nThe dame, so joyous enter, that the orb\\nGrew brighter at her smiles; and, if the star\\nWere mov\\'d to gladness, what then was my cheer,\\nWhom nature hath made apt for every change!\\n\\nAs in a quiet and clear lake the fish,\\nIf aught approach them from without, do draw\\nTowards it, deeming it their food; so drew\\nFull more than thousand splendours towards us,\\nAnd in each one was heard: \"Lo! one arriv\\'d\\nTo multiply our loves!\" and as each came\\nThe shadow, streaming forth effulgence new,\\nWitness\\'d augmented joy.  Here, reader! think,\\nIf thou didst miss the sequel of my tale,\\nTo know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave;\\nAnd thou shalt see what vehement desire\\nPossess\\'d me, as soon as these had met my view,\\nTo know their state.  \"O born in happy hour!\\nThou to whom grace vouchsafes, or ere thy close\\nOf fleshly warfare, to behold the thrones\\nOf that eternal triumph, know to us\\nThe light communicated, which through heaven\\nExpatiates without bound.  Therefore, if aught\\nThou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid,\\nSpare not; and of our radiance take thy fill.\"\\n\\nThus of those piteous spirits one bespake me;\\nAnd Beatrice next: \"Say on; and trust\\nAs unto gods!\"--\"How in the light supreme\\nThou harbour\\'st, and from thence the virtue bring\\'st,\\nThat, sparkling in thine eyes, denotes thy joy,\\nI mark; but, who thou art, am still to seek;\\nOr wherefore, worthy spirit! for thy lot\\nThis sphere assign\\'d, that oft from mortal ken\\nIs veil\\'d by others\\' beams.\"  I said, and turn\\'d\\nToward the lustre, that with greeting, kind\\nErewhile had hail\\'d me.  Forthwith brighter far\\nThan erst, it wax\\'d: and, as himself the sun\\nHides through excess of light, when his warm gaze\\nHath on the mantle of thick vapours prey\\'d;\\nWithin its proper ray the saintly shape\\nWas, through increase of gladness, thus conceal\\'d;\\nAnd, shrouded so in splendour answer\\'d me,\\nE\\'en as the tenour of my song declares.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO VI\\n\\n\"After that Constantine the eagle turn\\'d\\nAgainst the motions of the heav\\'n, that roll\\'d\\nConsenting with its course, when he of yore,\\nLavinia\\'s spouse, was leader of the flight,\\nA hundred years twice told and more, his seat\\nAt Europe\\'s extreme point, the bird of Jove\\nHeld, near the mountains, whence he issued first.\\nThere, under shadow of his sacred plumes\\nSwaying the world, till through successive hands\\nTo mine he came devolv\\'d.

Not long that mood\\nBeatrice suffer\\'d: she, with such a smile,\\nAs might have made one blest amid the flames,\\nBeaming upon me, thus her words began:\\n\"Thou in thy thought art pond\\'ring (as I deem),\\nAnd what I deem is truth how just revenge\\nCould be with justice punish\\'d: from which doubt\\nI soon will free thee; so thou mark my words;\\nFor they of weighty matter shall possess thee.\\n\\n\"That man, who was unborn, himself condemn\\'d,\\nAnd, in himself, all, who since him have liv\\'d,\\nHis offspring: whence, below, the human kind\\nLay sick in grievous error many an age;\\nUntil it pleas\\'d the Word of God to come\\nAmongst them down, to his own person joining\\nThe nature, from its Maker far estrang\\'d,\\nBy the mere act of his eternal love.\\nContemplate here the wonder I unfold.\\nThe nature with its Maker thus conjoin\\'d,\\nCreated first was blameless, pure and good;\\nBut through itself alone was driven forth\\nFrom Paradise, because it had eschew\\'d\\nThe way of truth and life, to evil turn\\'d.\\nNe\\'er then was penalty so just as that\\nInflicted by the cross, if thou regard\\nThe nature in assumption doom\\'d: ne\\'er wrong\\nSo great, in reference to him, who took\\nSuch nature on him, and endur\\'d the doom.\\nGod therefore and the Jews one sentence pleased:\\nSo different effects flow\\'d from one act,\\nAnd heav\\'n was open\\'d, though the earth did quake.\\nCount it not hard henceforth, when thou dost hear\\nThat a just vengeance was by righteous court\\nJustly reveng\\'d.  But yet I see thy mind\\nBy thought on thought arising sore perplex\\'d,\\nAnd with how vehement desire it asks\\nSolution of the maze.  What I have heard,\\nIs plain, thou sayst: but wherefore God this way\\nFor our redemption chose, eludes my search.\\n\\n\"Brother! no eye of man not perfected,\\nNor fully ripen\\'d in the flame of love,\\nMay fathom this decree.  It is a mark,\\nIn sooth, much aim\\'d at, and but little kenn\\'d:\\nAnd I will therefore show thee why such way\\nWas worthiest.  The celestial love, that spume\\nAll envying in its bounty, in itself\\nWith such effulgence blazeth, as sends forth\\nAll beauteous things eternal.  What distils\\nImmediate thence, no end of being knows,\\nBearing its seal immutably impress\\'d.\\nWhatever thence immediate falls, is free,\\nFree wholly, uncontrollable by power\\nOf each thing new: by such conformity\\nMore grateful to its author, whose bright beams,\\nThough all partake their shining, yet in those\\nAre liveliest, which resemble him the most.\\nThese tokens of pre-eminence on man\\nLargely bestow\\'d, if any of them fail,\\nHe needs must forfeit his nobility,\\nNo longer stainless.  Sin alone is that,\\nWhich doth disfranchise him, and make unlike\\nTo the chief good; for that its light in him\\nIs darken\\'d.  And to dignity thus lost\\nIs no return; unless, where guilt makes void,\\nHe for ill pleasure pay with equal pain.\\nYour nature, which entirely in its seed\\nTrangress\\'d, from these distinctions fell, no less\\nThan from its state in Paradise; nor means\\nFound of recovery (search all methods out\\nAs strickly as thou may) save one of these,\\nThe only fords were left through which to wade,\\nEither that God had of his courtesy\\nReleas\\'d him merely, or else man himself\\nFor his own folly by himself aton\\'d.\\n\\n\"Fix now thine eye, intently as thou canst,\\nOn th\\' everlasting counsel, and explore,\\nInstructed by my words, the dread abyss.\\n\\n\"Man in himself had ever lack\\'d the means\\nOf satisfaction, for he could not stoop\\nObeying, in humility so low,\\nAs high he, disobeying, thought to soar:\\nAnd for this reason he had vainly tried\\nOut of his own sufficiency to pay\\nThe rigid satisfaction.  Then behooved\\nThat God should by his own ways lead him back\\nUnto the life, from whence he fell, restor\\'d:\\nBy both his ways, I mean, or one alone.\\nBut since the deed is ever priz\\'d the more,\\nThe more the doer\\'s good intent appears,\\nGoodness celestial, whose broad signature\\nIs on the universe, of all its ways\\nTo raise ye up, was fain to leave out none,\\nNor aught so vast or so magnificent,\\nEither for him who gave or who receiv\\'d\\nBetween the last night and the primal day,\\nWas or can be.  For God more bounty show\\'d.\\nGiving himself to make man capable\\nOf his return to life, than had the terms\\nBeen mere and unconditional release.\\nAnd for his justice, every method else\\nWere all too scant, had not the Son of God\\nHumbled himself to put on mortal flesh.\\n\\n\"Now, to fulfil each wish of thine, remains\\nI somewhat further to thy view unfold.\\nThat thou mayst see as clearly as myself.\\n\\n\"I see, thou sayst, the air, the fire I see,\\nThe earth and water, and all things of them\\nCompounded, to corruption turn, and soon\\nDissolve.  Yet these were also things create,\\nBecause, if what were told me, had been true\\nThey from corruption had been therefore free.\\n\\n\"The angels, O my brother! and this clime\\nWherein thou art, impassible and pure,\\nI call created, as indeed they are\\nIn their whole being.  But the elements,\\nWhich thou hast nam\\'d, and what of them is made,\\nAre by created virtue\\' inform\\'d: create\\nTheir substance, and create the\\' informing virtue\\nIn these bright stars, that round them circling move\\nThe soul of every brute and of each plant,\\nThe ray and motion of the sacred lights,\\nWith complex potency attract and turn.\\nBut this our life the\\' eternal good inspires\\nImmediate, and enamours of itself;\\nSo that our wishes rest for ever here.\\n\\n\"And hence thou mayst by inference conclude\\nOur resurrection certain, if thy mind\\nConsider how the human flesh was fram\\'d,\\nWhen both our parents at the first were made.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO VIII\\n\\nThe world was in its day of peril dark\\nWont to believe the dotage of fond love\\nFrom the fair Cyprian deity, who rolls\\nIn her third epicycle, shed on men\\nBy stream of potent radiance: therefore they\\nOf elder time, in their old error blind,\\nNot her alone with sacrifice ador\\'d\\nAnd invocation, but like honours paid\\nTo Cupid and Dione, deem\\'d of them\\nHer mother, and her son, him whom they feign\\'d\\nTo sit in Dido\\'s bosom: and from her,\\nWhom I have sung preluding, borrow\\'d they\\nThe appellation of that star, which views,\\nNow obvious and now averse, the sun.\\n\\nI was not ware that I was wafted up\\nInto  its orb; but the new loveliness\\nThat grac\\'d my lady, gave me ample proof\\nThat we had entered there.  And as in flame\\nA sparkle is distinct, or voice in voice\\nDiscern\\'d, when one its even tenour keeps,\\nThe other comes and goes; so in that light\\nI other luminaries saw, that cours\\'d\\nIn circling motion, rapid more or less,\\nAs their eternal phases each impels.\\n\\nNever was blast from vapour charged with cold,\\nWhether invisible to eye or no,\\nDescended with such speed, it had not seem\\'d\\nTo linger in dull tardiness, compar\\'d\\nTo those celestial lights, that tow\\'rds us came,\\nLeaving the circuit of their joyous ring,\\nConducted by the lofty seraphim.\\nAnd after them, who in the van appear\\'d,\\nSuch an hosanna sounded, as hath left\\nDesire, ne\\'er since extinct in me, to hear\\nRenew\\'d the strain.  Then parting from the rest\\nOne near us drew, and sole began: \"We all\\nAre ready at thy pleasure, well dispos\\'d\\nTo do thee gentle service.  We are they,\\nTo whom thou in the world erewhile didst Sing\\n\\'O ye! whose intellectual ministry\\nMoves the third heaven!\\' and in one orb we roll,\\nOne motion, one impulse, with those who rule\\nPrincedoms in heaven; yet are of love so full,\\nThat to please thee \\'t will be as sweet to rest.\"\\n\\nAfter mine eyes had with meek reverence\\nSought the celestial guide, and were by her\\nAssur\\'d, they turn\\'d again unto the light\\nWho had so largely promis\\'d, and with voice\\nThat bare the lively pressure of my zeal,\\n\"Tell who ye are,\" I cried.  Forthwith it grew\\nIn size and splendour, through augmented joy;\\nAnd thus it answer\\'d: \"A short date below\\nThe world possess\\'d me.  Had the time been more,\\nMuch evil, that will come, had never chanc\\'d.\\nMy gladness hides thee from me, which doth shine\\nAround, and shroud me, as an animal\\nIn its own silk unswath\\'d.  Thou lov\\'dst me well,\\nAnd had\\'st good cause; for had my sojourning\\nBeen longer on the earth, the love I bare thee\\nHad put forth more than blossoms.  The left bank,\\nThat Rhone, when he hath mix\\'d with Sorga, laves.\\n\\n\"In me its lord expected, and that horn\\nOf fair Ausonia, with its boroughs old,\\nBari, and Croton, and Gaeta pil\\'d,\\nFrom where the Trento disembogues his waves,\\nWith Verde mingled, to the salt sea-flood.\\nAlready on my temples beam\\'d the crown,\\nWhich gave me sov\\'reignty over the land\\nBy Danube wash\\'d, whenas he strays beyond\\nThe limits of his German shores.  The realm,\\nWhere, on the gulf by stormy Eurus lash\\'d,\\nBetwixt Pelorus and Pachynian heights,\\nThe beautiful Trinacria lies in gloom\\n(Not through Typhaeus, but the vap\\'ry cloud\\nBituminous upsteam\\'d), THAT too did look\\nTo have its scepter wielded by a race\\nOf monarchs, sprung through me from Charles and Rodolph;\\nhad not ill lording which doth spirit up\\nThe people ever, in Palermo rais\\'d\\nThe shout of \\'death,\\' re-echo\\'d loud and long.\\nHad but my brother\\'s foresight kenn\\'d as much,\\nHe had been warier that the greedy want\\nOf Catalonia might not work his bale.\\nAnd truly need there is, that he forecast,\\nOr other for him, lest more freight be laid\\nOn his already over-laden bark.\\nNature in him, from bounty fall\\'n to thrift,\\nWould ask the  guard of braver arms, than such\\nAs only care to have their coffers fill\\'d.\"\\n\\n\"My liege, it doth enhance the joy thy words\\nInfuse into me, mighty as it is,\\nTo think my gladness manifest to thee,\\nAs to myself, who own it, when thou lookst\\nInto the source and limit of all good,\\nThere, where thou markest that which thou dost speak,\\nThence priz\\'d of me the more.  Glad thou hast made me.\\nNow make intelligent, clearing the doubt\\nThy speech hath raised in me; for much I muse,\\nHow bitter can spring up, when sweet is sown.\"\\n\\nI thus inquiring; he forthwith replied:\\n\"If I have power to show one truth, soon that\\nShall face thee, which thy questioning declares\\nBehind thee now conceal\\'d.  The Good, that guides\\nAnd blessed makes this realm, which thou dost mount,\\nOrdains its providence to be the virtue\\nIn these great bodies: nor th\\' all perfect Mind\\nUpholds their nature merely, but in them\\nTheir energy to save: for nought, that lies\\nWithin the range of that unerring bow,\\nBut is as level with the destin\\'d aim,\\nAs ever mark to arrow\\'s point oppos\\'d.\\nWere it not thus, these heavens, thou dost visit,\\nWould their effect so work, it would not be\\nArt, but destruction; and this may not chance,\\nIf th\\' intellectual powers, that move these stars,\\nFail not, or who, first faulty made them fail.\\nWilt thou this truth more clearly evidenc\\'d?\"\\n\\nTo whom I thus: \"It is enough: no fear,\\nI see, lest nature in her part should tire.\"\\n\\nHe straight rejoin\\'d: \"Say, were it worse for man,\\nIf he liv\\'d not in fellowship on earth?\"\\n\\n\"Yea,\" answer\\'d I; \"nor here a reason needs.\"\\n\\n\"And may that be, if different estates\\nGrow not of different duties in your life?\\nConsult your teacher, and he tells you \\'no.\"\\'\\n\\nThus did he come, deducing to this point,\\nAnd then concluded: \"For this cause behooves,\\nThe roots, from whence your operations come,\\nMust differ.  Therefore one is Solon born;\\nAnother, Xerxes; and Melchisidec\\nA third; and he a fourth, whose airy voyage\\nCost him his son.  In her circuitous course,\\nNature, that is the seal to mortal wax,\\nDoth well her art, but no distinctions owns\\n\\'Twixt one or other household.  Hence befalls\\nThat Esau is so wide of Jacob: hence\\nQuirinus of so base a father springs,\\nHe dates from Mars his lineage.  Were it not\\nThat providence celestial overrul\\'d,\\nNature, in generation, must the path\\nTrac\\'d by the generator, still pursue\\nUnswervingly.  Thus place I in thy sight\\nThat, which was late behind thee.  But, in sign\\nOf more affection for thee, \\'t is my will\\nThou wear this corollary.  Nature ever\\nFinding discordant fortune, like all seed\\nOut of its proper climate, thrives but ill.\\nAnd were the world below content to mark\\nAnd work on the foundation nature lays,\\nIt would not lack supply of excellence.\\nBut ye perversely to religion strain\\nHim, who was born to gird on him the sword,\\nAnd of the fluent phrasemen make your king;\\nTherefore your steps have wander\\'d from the paths.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO IX\\n\\nAfter solution of my doubt, thy Charles,\\nO fair Clemenza, of the treachery spake\\nThat must befall his seed: but, \"Tell it not,\"\\nSaid he, \"and let the destin\\'d years come round.\"\\nNor may I tell thee more, save that the meed\\nOf sorrow well-deserv\\'d shall quit your wrongs.\\n\\nAnd now the visage of that saintly light\\nWas to the sun, that fills it, turn\\'d again,\\nAs to the good, whose plenitude of bliss\\nSufficeth all.  O ye misguided souls!\\nInfatuate, who from such a good estrange\\nYour hearts, and bend your gaze on vanity,\\nAlas for you!--And lo! toward me, next,\\nAnother of those splendent forms approach\\'d,\\nThat, by its outward bright\\'ning, testified\\nThe will it had to pleasure me.  The eyes\\nOf Beatrice, resting, as before,\\nFirmly upon me, manifested forth\\nApproval of my wish.  \"And O,\" I cried,\\n\"Blest spirit! quickly be my will perform\\'d;\\nAnd prove thou to me, that my inmost thoughts\\nI can reflect on thee.\"  Thereat the light,\\nThat yet was new to me, from the recess,\\nWhere it before was singing, thus began,\\nAs one who joys in kindness: \"In that part\\nOf the deprav\\'d Italian land, which lies\\nBetween Rialto, and the fountain-springs\\nOf Brenta and of Piava, there doth rise,\\nBut to no lofty eminence, a hill,\\nFrom whence erewhile a firebrand did descend,\\nThat sorely sheet the region.  From one root\\nI and it sprang; my name on earth Cunizza:\\nAnd here I glitter, for that by its light\\nThis star o\\'ercame me.  Yet I naught repine,\\nNor grudge myself the cause of this my lot,\\nWhich haply vulgar hearts can scarce conceive.\\n\\n\"This jewel, that is next me in our heaven,\\nLustrous and costly, great renown hath left,\\nAnd not to perish, ere these hundred years\\nFive times absolve their round.  Consider thou,\\nIf to excel be worthy man\\'s endeavour,\\nWhen such life may attend the first.  Yet they\\nCare not for this, the crowd that now are girt\\nBy Adice and Tagliamento, still\\nImpenitent, tho\\' scourg\\'d.  The hour is near,\\nWhen for their stubbornness at Padua\\'s marsh\\nThe water shall be chang\\'d, that laves Vicena\\nAnd where Cagnano meets with Sile, one\\nLords it, and bears his head aloft, for whom\\nThe web is now a-warping.  Feltro too\\nShall sorrow for its godless shepherd\\'s fault,\\nOf so deep stain, that never, for the like,\\nWas Malta\\'s bar unclos\\'d.  Too large should be\\nThe skillet, that would hold Ferrara\\'s blood,\\nAnd wearied he, who ounce by ounce would weight it,\\nThe which this priest, in show of party-zeal,\\nCourteous will give; nor will the gift ill suit\\nThe country\\'s custom.  We descry above,\\nMirrors, ye call them thrones, from which to us\\nReflected shine the judgments of our God:\\nWhence these our sayings we avouch for good.\"\\n\\nShe ended, and appear\\'d on other thoughts\\nIntent, re-ent\\'ring on the wheel she late\\nHad left.  That other joyance meanwhile wax\\'d\\nA thing to marvel at, in splendour glowing,\\nLike choicest ruby stricken by the sun,\\nFor, in that upper clime, effulgence comes\\nOf gladness, as here laughter: and below,\\nAs the mind saddens, murkier grows the shade.\\n\\n\"God seeth all: and in him is thy sight,\"\\nSaid I, \"blest Spirit!  Therefore will of his\\nCannot to thee be dark.  Why then delays\\nThy voice to satisfy my wish untold,\\nThat voice which joins the inexpressive song,\\nPastime of heav\\'n, the which those ardours sing,\\nThat cowl them with six shadowing wings outspread?\\nI would not wait thy asking, wert thou known\\nTo me, as thoroughly I to thee am known.\"\\n\\nHe forthwith answ\\'ring, thus his words began:\\n\"The valley\\' of waters, widest next to that\\nWhich doth the earth engarland, shapes its course,\\nBetween discordant shores, against the sun\\nInward so far, it makes meridian there,\\nWhere was before th\\' horizon.  Of that vale\\nDwelt I upon the shore, \\'twixt Ebro\\'s stream\\nAnd Macra\\'s, that divides with passage brief\\nGenoan bounds from Tuscan.  East and west\\nAre nearly one to Begga and my land,\\nWhose haven erst was with its own blood warm.\\nWho knew my name were wont to call me Folco:\\nAnd I did bear impression of this heav\\'n,\\nThat now bears mine: for not with fiercer flame\\nGlow\\'d Belus\\' daughter, injuring alike\\nSichaeus and Creusa, than did I,\\nLong as it suited the unripen\\'d down\\nThat fledg\\'d my cheek: nor she of Rhodope,\\nThat was beguiled of Demophoon;\\nNor Jove\\'s son, when the charms of Iole\\nWere shrin\\'d within his heart.  And yet there hides\\nNo sorrowful repentance here, but mirth,\\nNot for the fault (that doth not come to mind),\\nBut for the virtue, whose o\\'erruling sway\\nAnd providence have wrought thus quaintly.  Here\\nThe skill is look\\'d into, that fashioneth\\nWith such effectual working, and the good\\nDiscern\\'d, accruing to this upper world\\nFrom that below.  But fully to content\\nThy wishes, all that in this sphere have birth,\\nDemands my further parle.  Inquire thou wouldst,\\nWho of this light is denizen, that here\\nBeside me sparkles, as the sun-beam doth\\nOn the clear wave.  Know then, the soul of Rahab\\nIs in that gladsome harbour, to our tribe\\nUnited, and the foremost rank assign\\'d.\\nHe to that heav\\'n, at which the shadow ends\\nOf your sublunar world, was taken up,\\nFirst, in Christ\\'s triumph, of all souls redeem\\'d:\\nFor well behoov\\'d, that, in some part of heav\\'n,\\nShe should remain a trophy, to declare\\nThe mighty contest won with either palm;\\nFor that she favour\\'d first the high exploit\\nOf Joshua on the holy land, whereof\\nThe Pope recks little now.  Thy city, plant\\nOf him, that on his Maker turn\\'d the back,\\nAnd of whose envying so much woe hath sprung,\\nEngenders and expands the cursed flower,\\nThat hath made wander both the sheep and lambs,\\nTurning the shepherd to a wolf.  For this,\\nThe gospel and great teachers laid aside,\\nThe decretals, as their stuft margins show,\\nAre the sole study.  Pope and Cardinals,\\nIntent on these, ne\\'er journey but in thought\\nTo Nazareth, where Gabriel op\\'d his wings.\\nYet it may chance, erelong, the Vatican,\\nAnd other most selected parts of Rome,\\nThat were the grave of Peter\\'s soldiery,\\nShall be deliver\\'d from the adult\\'rous bond.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO X\\n\\nLooking into his first-born with the love,\\nWhich breathes from both eternal, the first Might\\nIneffable, whence eye or mind\\nCan roam, hath in such order all dispos\\'d,\\nAs none may see and fail to enjoy.  Raise, then,\\nO reader! to the lofty wheels, with me,\\nThy ken directed to the point, whereat\\nOne motion strikes on th\\' other.  There begin\\nThy wonder of the mighty Architect,\\nWho loves his work so inwardly, his eye\\nDoth ever watch it.  See, how thence oblique\\nBrancheth the circle, where the planets roll\\nTo pour their wished influence on the world;\\nWhose path not bending thus, in heav\\'n above\\nMuch virtue would be lost, and here on earth,\\nAll power well nigh extinct: or, from direct\\nWere its departure distant more or less,\\nI\\' th\\' universal order, great defect\\nMust, both in heav\\'n and here beneath, ensue.\\n\\nNow rest thee, reader! on thy bench, and muse\\nAnticipative of the feast to come;\\nSo shall delight make thee not feel thy toil.\\nLo! I have set before thee, for thyself\\nFeed now: the matter I indite, henceforth\\nDemands entire my thought.  Join\\'d with the part,\\nWhich late we told of, the great minister\\nOf nature, that upon the world imprints\\nThe virtue of the heaven, and doles out\\nTime for us with his beam, went circling on\\nAlong the spires, where each hour sooner comes;\\nAnd I was with him, weetless of ascent,\\nAs one, who till arriv\\'d, weets not his coming.\\n\\nFor Beatrice, she who passeth on\\nSo suddenly from good to better, time\\nCounts not the act, oh then how great must needs\\nHave been her brightness!  What she was i\\' th\\' sun\\n(Where I had enter\\'d), not through change of hue,\\nBut light transparent--did I summon up\\nGenius, art, practice--I might not so speak,\\nIt should be e\\'er imagin\\'d: yet believ\\'d\\nIt may be, and the sight be justly crav\\'d.\\nAnd if our fantasy fail of such height,\\nWhat marvel, since no eye above the sun\\nHath ever travel\\'d?  Such are they dwell here,\\nFourth family of the Omnipotent Sire,\\nWho of his spirit and of his offspring shows;\\nAnd holds them still enraptur\\'d with the view.\\nAnd thus to me Beatrice: \"Thank, oh thank,\\nThe Sun of angels, him, who by his grace\\nTo this perceptible hath lifted thee.\"\\n\\nNever was heart in such devotion bound,\\nAnd with complacency so absolute\\nDispos\\'d to render up itself to God,\\nAs mine was at those words: and so entire\\nThe love for Him, that held me, it eclips\\'d\\nBeatrice in oblivion.  Naught displeas\\'d\\nWas she, but smil\\'d thereat so joyously,\\nThat of her laughing eyes the radiance brake\\nAnd scatter\\'d my collected mind abroad.\\n\\nThen saw I a bright band, in liveliness\\nSurpassing, who themselves did make the crown,\\nAnd us their centre: yet more sweet in voice,\\nThan in their visage beaming.  Cinctur\\'d thus,\\nSometime Latona\\'s daughter we behold,\\nWhen the impregnate air retains the thread,\\nThat weaves her zone.  In the celestial court,\\nWhence I return, are many jewels found,\\nSo dear and beautiful, they cannot brook\\nTransporting from that realm: and of these lights\\nSuch was the song.  Who doth not prune his wing\\nTo soar up thither, let him look from thence\\nFor tidings from the dumb.  When, singing thus,\\nThose burning suns that circled round us thrice,\\nAs nearest stars around the fixed pole,\\nThen seem\\'d they like to ladies, from the dance\\nNot ceasing, but suspense, in silent pause,\\nList\\'ning, till they have caught the strain anew:\\nSuspended so they stood: and, from within,\\nThus heard I one, who spake: \"Since with its beam\\nThe grace, whence true love lighteth first his flame,\\nThat after doth increase by loving, shines\\nSo multiplied in thee, it leads thee up\\nAlong this ladder, down whose hallow\\'d steps\\nNone e\\'er descend, and mount them not again,\\nWho from his phial should refuse thee wine\\nTo slake thy thirst, no less constrained were,\\nThan water flowing not unto the sea.\\nThou fain wouldst hear, what plants are these, that bloom\\nIn the bright garland, which, admiring, girds\\nThis fair dame round, who strengthens thee for heav\\'n.\\nI then was of the lambs, that Dominic\\nLeads, for his saintly flock, along the way,\\nWhere well they thrive, not sworn with vanity.\\nHe, nearest on my right hand, brother was,\\nAnd master to me: Albert of Cologne\\nIs this: and of Aquinum, Thomas I.\\nIf thou of all the rest wouldst be assur\\'d,\\nLet thine eye, waiting on the words I speak,\\nIn circuit journey round the blessed wreath.\\nThat next resplendence issues from the smile\\nOf Gratian, who to either forum lent\\nSuch help, as favour wins in Paradise.\\nThe other, nearest, who adorns our quire,\\nWas Peter, he that with the widow gave\\nTo holy church his treasure.  The fifth light,\\nGoodliest of all, is by such love inspired,\\nThat all your world craves tidings of its doom:\\nWithin, there is the lofty light, endow\\'d\\nWith sapience so profound, if truth be truth,\\nThat with a ken of such wide amplitude\\nNo second hath arisen.  Next behold\\nThat taper\\'s radiance, to whose view was shown,\\nClearliest, the nature and the ministry\\nAngelical, while yet in flesh it dwelt.\\nIn the other little light serenely smiles\\nThat pleader for the Christian temples, he\\nWho did provide Augustin of his lore.\\nNow, if thy mind\\'s eye pass from light to light,\\nUpon my praises following, of the eighth\\nThy thirst is next.  The saintly soul, that shows\\nThe world\\'s deceitfulness, to all who hear him,\\nIs, with the sight of all the good, that is,\\nBlest there.  The limbs, whence it was driven, lie\\nDown in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom\\nAnd exile came it here.  Lo! further on,\\nWhere flames the arduous Spirit of Isidore,\\nOf Bede, and Richard, more than man, erewhile,\\nIn deep discernment.  Lastly this, from whom\\nThy look on me reverteth, was the beam\\nOf one, whose spirit, on high musings bent,\\nRebuk\\'d the ling\\'ring tardiness of death.\\nIt is the eternal light of Sigebert,\\nWho \\'scap\\'d not envy, when of truth he argued,\\nReading in the straw-litter\\'d street.\"  Forthwith,\\nAs clock, that calleth up the spouse of God\\nTo win her bridegroom\\'s love at matin\\'s hour,\\nEach part of other fitly drawn and urg\\'d,\\nSends out a tinkling sound, of note so sweet,\\nAffection springs in well-disposed breast;\\nThus saw I move the glorious wheel, thus heard\\nVoice answ\\'ring voice, so musical and soft,\\nIt can be known but where day endless shines.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XI\\n\\nO fond anxiety of mortal men!\\nHow vain and inconclusive arguments\\nAre those, which make thee beat thy wings below\\nFor statues one, and one for aphorisms\\nWas hunting; this the priesthood follow\\'d, that\\nBy force or sophistry aspir\\'d to rule;\\nTo rob another, and another sought\\nBy civil business wealth; one moiling lay\\nTangled in net of sensual delight,\\nAnd one to witless indolence resign\\'d;\\nWhat time from all these empty things escap\\'d,\\nWith Beatrice, I thus gloriously\\nWas rais\\'d aloft, and made the guest of heav\\'n.\\n\\nThey of the circle to that point, each one.\\nWhere erst it was, had turn\\'d; and steady glow\\'d,\\nAs candle in his socket.

There was sung\\nNo Bacchus, and no Io Paean, but\\nThree Persons in the Godhead, and in one\\nSubstance that nature and the human join\\'d.\\n\\nThe song fulfill\\'d its measure; and to us\\nThose saintly lights attended, happier made\\nAt each new minist\\'ring.  Then silence brake,\\nAmid th\\' accordant sons of Deity,\\nThat luminary, in which the wondrous life\\nOf the meek man of God was told to me;\\nAnd thus it spake: \"One ear o\\' th\\' harvest thresh\\'d,\\nAnd its grain safely stor\\'d, sweet charity\\nInvites me with the other to like toil.\\n\\n\"Thou know\\'st, that in the bosom, whence the rib\\nWas ta\\'en to fashion that fair cheek, whose taste\\nAll the world pays for, and in that, which pierc\\'d\\nBy the keen lance, both after and before\\nSuch satisfaction offer\\'d, as outweighs\\nEach evil in the scale, whate\\'er of light\\nTo human nature is allow\\'d, must all\\nHave by his virtue been infus\\'d, who form\\'d\\nBoth one and other: and thou thence admir\\'st\\nIn that I told thee, of beatitudes\\nA second, there is none, to his enclos\\'d\\nIn the fifth radiance.

Tell him, if the light,\\nWherewith your substance blooms, shall stay with you\\nEternally, as now: and, if it doth,\\nHow, when ye shall regain your visible forms,\\nThe sight may without harm endure the change,\\nThat also tell.\"  As those, who in a ring\\nTread the light measure, in their fitful mirth\\nRaise loud the voice, and spring with gladder bound;\\nThus, at the hearing of that pious suit,\\nThe saintly circles in their tourneying\\nAnd wond\\'rous note attested new delight.\\n\\nWhoso laments, that we must doff this garb\\nOf frail mortality, thenceforth to live\\nImmortally above, he hath not seen\\nThe sweet refreshing, of that heav\\'nly shower.\\n\\nHim, who lives ever, and for ever reigns\\nIn mystic union of the Three in One,\\nUnbounded, bounding all, each spirit thrice\\nSang, with such melody, as but to hear\\nFor highest merit were an ample meed.\\nAnd from the lesser orb the goodliest light,\\nWith gentle voice and mild, such as perhaps\\nThe angel\\'s once to Mary, thus replied:\\n\"Long as the joy of Paradise shall last,\\nOur love shall shine around that raiment, bright,\\nAs fervent; fervent, as in vision blest;\\nAnd that as far in blessedness exceeding,\\nAs it hath grave beyond its virtue great.\\nOur shape, regarmented with glorious weeds\\nOf saintly flesh, must, being thus entire,\\nShow yet more gracious.  Therefore shall increase,\\nWhate\\'er of light, gratuitous, imparts\\nThe Supreme Good; light, ministering aid,\\nThe better disclose his glory: whence\\nThe vision needs increasing, much increase\\nThe fervour, which it kindles; and that too\\nThe ray, that comes from it.  But as the greed\\nWhich gives out flame, yet it its whiteness shines\\nMore lively than that, and so preserves\\nIts proper semblance; thus this circling sphere\\nOf splendour, shall to view less radiant seem,\\nThan shall our fleshly robe, which yonder earth\\nNow covers.  Nor will such excess of light\\nO\\'erpower us, in corporeal organs made\\nFirm, and susceptible of all delight.\"\\n\\nSo ready and so cordial an \"Amen,\"\\nFollowed from either choir, as plainly spoke\\nDesire of their dead bodies; yet perchance\\nNot for themselves, but for their kindred dear,\\nMothers and sires, and those whom best they lov\\'d,\\nEre they were made imperishable flame.\\n\\nAnd lo! forthwith there rose up round about\\nA lustre over that already there,\\nOf equal clearness, like the brightening up\\nOf the horizon.  As at an evening hour\\nOf twilight, new appearances through heav\\'n\\nPeer with faint glimmer, doubtfully descried;\\nSo there new substances, methought began\\nTo rise in view; and round the other twain\\nEnwheeling, sweep their ampler circuit wide.\\n\\nO gentle glitter of eternal beam!\\nWith what a such whiteness did it flow,\\nO\\'erpowering vision in me!  But so fair,\\nSo passing lovely, Beatrice show\\'d,\\nMind cannot follow it, nor words express\\nHer infinite sweetness.  Thence mine eyes regain\\'d\\nPower to look up, and I beheld myself,\\nSole with my lady, to more lofty bliss\\nTranslated: for the star, with warmer smile\\nImpurpled, well denoted our ascent.\\n\\nWith all the heart, and with that tongue which speaks\\nThe same in all, an holocaust I made\\nTo God, befitting the new grace vouchsaf\\'d.\\nAnd from my bosom had not yet upsteam\\'d\\nThe fuming of that incense, when I knew\\nThe rite accepted.  With such mighty sheen\\nAnd mantling crimson, in two listed rays\\nThe splendours shot before me, that I cried,\\n\"God of Sabaoth! that does prank them thus!\"\\n\\nAs leads the galaxy from pole to pole,\\nDistinguish\\'d into greater lights and less,\\nIts pathway, which the wisest fail to spell;\\nSo thickly studded, in the depth of Mars,\\nThose rays describ\\'d the venerable sign,\\nThat quadrants in the round conjoining frame.\\nHere memory mocks the toil of genius.  Christ\\nBeam\\'d on that cross; and pattern fails me now.\\nBut whoso takes his cross, and follows Christ\\nWill pardon me for that I leave untold,\\nWhen in the flecker\\'d dawning he shall spy\\nThe glitterance of Christ.  From horn to horn,\\nAnd \\'tween the summit and the base did move\\nLights, scintillating, as they met and pass\\'d.\\nThus oft are seen, with ever-changeful glance,\\nStraight or athwart, now rapid and now slow,\\nThe atomies of bodies, long or short,\\nTo move along the sunbeam, whose slant line\\nCheckers the shadow, interpos\\'d by art\\nAgainst the noontide heat.  And as the chime\\nOf minstrel music, dulcimer, and help\\nWith many strings, a pleasant dining makes\\nTo him, who heareth not distinct the note;\\nSo from the lights, which there appear\\'d to me,\\nGather\\'d along the cross a melody,\\nThat, indistinctly heard, with ravishment\\nPossess\\'d me.  Yet I mark\\'d it was a hymn\\nOf lofty praises; for there came to me\\n\"Arise and conquer,\" as to one who hears\\nAnd comprehends not.  Me such ecstasy\\nO\\'ercame, that never till that hour was thing\\nThat held me in so sweet imprisonment.\\n\\nPerhaps my saying over bold appears,\\nAccounting less the pleasure of those eyes,\\nWhereon to look fulfilleth all desire.\\nBut he, who is aware those living seals\\nOf every beauty work with quicker force,\\nThe higher they are ris\\'n; and that there\\nI had not turn\\'d me to them; he may well\\nExcuse me that, whereof in my excuse\\nI do accuse me, and may own my truth;\\nThat holy pleasure here not yet reveal\\'d,\\nWhich grows in transport as we mount aloof.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XV\\n\\nTrue love, that ever shows itself as clear\\nIn kindness, as loose appetite in wrong,\\nSilenced that lyre harmonious, and still\\'d\\nThe sacred chords, that are by heav\\'n\\'s right hand\\nUnwound and tighten\\'d, flow to righteous prayers\\nShould they not hearken, who, to give me will\\nFor praying, in accordance thus were mute?\\nHe hath in sooth good cause for endless grief,\\nWho, for the love of thing that lasteth not,\\nDespoils himself forever of that love.\\n\\nAs oft along the still and pure serene,\\nAt nightfall, glides a sudden trail of fire,\\nAttracting with involuntary heed\\nThe eye to follow it, erewhile at rest,\\nAnd seems some star that shifted place in heav\\'n,\\nOnly that, whence it kindles, none is lost,\\nAnd it is soon extinct; thus from the horn,\\nThat on the dexter of the cross extends,\\nDown to its foot, one luminary ran\\nFrom mid the cluster shone there; yet no gem\\nDropp\\'d from its foil; and through the beamy list\\nLike flame in alabaster, glow\\'d its course.\\n\\nSo forward stretch\\'d him (if of credence aught\\nOur greater muse may claim) the pious ghost\\nOf old Anchises, in the\\' Elysian bower,\\nWhen he perceiv\\'d his son.  \"O thou, my blood!\\nO most exceeding grace divine! to whom,\\nAs now to thee, hath twice the heav\\'nly gate\\nBeen e\\'er unclos\\'d?\" so spake the light; whence I\\nTurn\\'d me toward him; then unto my dame\\nMy sight directed, and on either side\\nAmazement waited me; for in her eyes\\nWas lighted such a smile, I thought that mine\\nHad div\\'d unto the bottom of my grace\\nAnd of my bliss in Paradise.  Forthwith\\nTo hearing and to sight grateful alike,\\nThe spirit to his proem added things\\nI understood not, so profound he spake;\\nYet not of choice but through necessity\\nMysterious; for his high conception scar\\'d\\nBeyond the mark of mortals.  When the flight\\nOf holy transport had so spent its rage,\\nThat nearer to the level of our thought\\nThe speech descended, the first sounds I heard\\nWere, \"Best he thou, Triunal Deity!\\nThat hast such favour in my seed vouchsaf\\'d!\"\\nThen follow\\'d: \"No unpleasant thirst, tho\\' long,\\nWhich took me reading in the sacred book,\\nWhose leaves or white or dusky never change,\\nThou hast allay\\'d, my son, within this light,\\nFrom whence my voice thou hear\\'st; more thanks to her.\\nWho for such lofty mounting has with plumes\\nBegirt thee.  Thou dost deem thy thoughts to me\\nFrom him transmitted, who is first of all,\\nE\\'en as all numbers ray from unity;\\nAnd therefore dost not ask me who I am,\\nOr why to thee more joyous I appear,\\nThan any other in this gladsome throng.\\nThe truth is as thou deem\\'st; for in this hue\\nBoth less and greater in that mirror look,\\nIn which thy thoughts, or ere thou think\\'st, are shown.\\nBut, that the love, which keeps me wakeful ever,\\nUrging with sacred thirst of sweet desire,\\nMay be contended fully, let thy voice,\\nFearless, and frank and jocund, utter forth\\nThy will distinctly, utter forth the wish,\\nWhereto my ready answer stands decreed.\"\\n\\nI turn\\'d me to Beatrice; and she heard\\nEre I had spoken, smiling, an assent,\\nThat to my will gave wings; and I began\\n\"To each among your tribe, what time ye kenn\\'d\\nThe nature, in whom naught unequal dwells,\\nWisdom and love were in one measure dealt;\\nFor that they are so equal in the sun,\\nFrom whence ye drew your radiance and your heat,\\nAs makes all likeness scant.  But will and means,\\nIn mortals, for the cause ye well discern,\\nWith unlike wings are fledge.

This howe\\'er\\nI pray thee, living topaz! that ingemm\\'st\\nThis precious jewel, let me hear thy name.\"\\n\\n\"I am thy root, O leaf! whom to expect\\nEven, hath pleas\\'d me:\" thus the prompt reply\\nPrefacing, next it added; \"he, of whom\\nThy kindred appellation comes, and who,\\nThese hundred years and more, on its first ledge\\nHath circuited the mountain, was my son\\nAnd thy great grandsire.

Thus much\\nYet may I speak; that, as I gaz\\'d on her,\\nAffection found no room for other wish.\\nWhile the everlasting pleasure, that did full\\nOn Beatrice shine, with second view\\nFrom her fair countenance my gladden\\'d soul\\nContented; vanquishing me with a beam\\nOf her soft smile, she spake: \"Turn thee, and list.\\nThese eyes are not thy only Paradise.\"\\n\\nAs here we sometimes in the looks may see\\nTh\\' affection mark\\'d, when that its sway hath ta\\'en\\nThe spirit wholly; thus the hallow\\'d light,\\nTo whom I turn\\'d, flashing, bewray\\'d its will\\nTo talk yet further with me, and began:\\n\"On this fifth lodgment of the tree, whose life\\nIs from its top, whose fruit is ever fair\\nAnd leaf unwith\\'ring, blessed spirits abide,\\nThat were below, ere they arriv\\'d in heav\\'n,\\nSo mighty in renown, as every muse\\nMight grace her triumph with them.  On the horns\\nLook therefore of the cross: he, whom I name,\\nShall there enact, as doth in summer cloud\\nIts nimble fire.\"  Along the cross I saw,\\nAt the repeated name of Joshua,\\nA splendour gliding; nor, the word was said,\\nEre it was done: then, at the naming saw\\nOf the great Maccabee, another move\\nWith whirling speed; and gladness was the scourge\\nUnto that top.  The next for Charlemagne\\nAnd for the peer Orlando, two my gaze\\nPursued, intently, as the eye pursues\\nA falcon flying.  Last, along the cross,\\nWilliam, and Renard, and Duke Godfrey drew\\nMy ken, and Robert Guiscard.  And the soul,\\nWho spake with me among the other lights\\nDid move away, and mix; and with the choir\\nOf heav\\'nly songsters prov\\'d his tuneful skill.\\n\\nTo Beatrice on my right l bent,\\nLooking for intimation or by word\\nOr act, what next behoov\\'d; and did descry\\nSuch mere effulgence in her eyes, such joy,\\nIt past all former wont.  And, as by sense\\nOf new delight, the man, who perseveres\\nIn good deeds doth perceive from day to day\\nHis virtue growing; I e\\'en thus perceiv\\'d\\nOf my ascent, together with the heav\\'n\\nThe circuit widen\\'d, noting the increase\\nOf beauty in that wonder.  Like the change\\nIn a brief moment on some maiden\\'s cheek,\\nWhich from its fairness doth discharge the weight\\nOf pudency, that stain\\'d it; such in her,\\nAnd to mine eyes so sudden was the change,\\nThrough silvery whiteness of that temperate star,\\nWhose sixth orb now enfolded us.  I saw,\\nWithin that Jovial cresset, the clear sparks\\nOf love, that reign\\'d there, fashion to my view\\nOur language.  And as birds, from river banks\\nArisen, now in round, now lengthen\\'d troop,\\nArray them in their flight, greeting, as seems,\\nTheir new-found pastures; so, within the lights,\\nThe saintly creatures flying, sang, and made\\nNow D. now I. now L. figur\\'d I\\' th\\' air.\\n\\nFirst, singing, to their notes they mov\\'d, then one\\nBecoming of these signs, a little while\\nDid rest them, and were mute.

Be thy power\\nDisplay\\'d in this brief song.  The characters,\\nVocal and consonant, were five-fold seven.\\nIn order each, as they appear\\'d, I mark\\'d.\\nDiligite Justitiam, the first,\\nBoth verb and noun all blazon\\'d; and the extreme\\nQui judicatis terram.  In the M.\\nOf the fifth word they held their station,\\nMaking the star seem silver streak\\'d with gold.\\nAnd on the summit of the M. I saw\\nDescending other lights, that rested there,\\nSinging, methinks, their bliss and primal good.\\nThen, as at shaking of a lighted brand,\\nSparkles innumerable on all sides\\nRise scatter\\'d, source of augury to th\\' unwise;\\nThus more than thousand twinkling lustres hence\\nSeem\\'d reascending, and a higher pitch\\nSome mounting, and some less; e\\'en as the sun,\\nWhich kindleth them, decreed.  And when each one\\nHad settled in his place, the head and neck\\nThen saw I of an eagle, lively\\nGrav\\'d in that streaky fire.  Who painteth there,\\nHath none to guide him; of himself he guides;\\nAnd every line and texture of the nest\\nDoth own from him the virtue, fashions it.\\nThe other bright beatitude, that seem\\'d\\nErewhile, with lilied crowning, well content\\nTo over-canopy the M. mov\\'d forth,\\nFollowing gently the impress of the bird.\\n\\n Sweet star! what glorious and thick-studded gems\\nDeclar\\'d to me our justice on the earth\\nTo be the effluence of that heav\\'n, which thou,\\nThyself a costly jewel, dost inlay!\\nTherefore I pray the Sovran Mind, from whom\\nThy motion and thy virtue are begun,\\nThat he would look from whence the fog doth rise,\\nTo vitiate thy beam: so that once more\\nHe may put forth his hand \\'gainst such, as drive\\nTheir traffic in that sanctuary, whose walls\\nWith miracles and martyrdoms were built.\\n\\nYe host of heaven! whose glory I survey!\\nO beg ye grace for those, that are on earth\\nAll after ill example gone astray.\\nWar once had for its instrument the sword:\\nBut now \\'t is made, taking the bread away\\nWhich the good Father locks from none.  --And thou,\\nThat writes but to cancel, think, that they,\\nWho for the vineyard, which thou wastest, died,\\nPeter and Paul live yet, and mark thy doings.\\nThou hast good cause to cry, \"My heart so cleaves\\nTo him, that liv\\'d in solitude remote,\\nAnd from the wilds was dragg\\'d to martyrdom,\\nI wist not of the fisherman nor Paul.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XIX\\n\\nBefore my sight appear\\'d, with open wings,\\nThe beauteous image, in fruition sweet\\nGladdening the thronged spirits.  Each did seem\\nA little ruby, whereon so intense\\nThe sun-beam glow\\'d that to mine eyes it came\\nIn clear refraction.  And that, which next\\nBefalls me to portray, voice hath not utter\\'d,\\nNor hath ink written, nor in fantasy\\nWas e\\'er conceiv\\'d.  For I beheld and heard\\nThe beak discourse; and, what intention form\\'d\\nOf many, singly as of one express,\\nBeginning: \"For that I was just and piteous,\\nl am exalted to this height of glory,\\nThe which no wish exceeds: and there on earth\\nHave I my memory left, e\\'en by the bad\\nCommended, while they leave its course untrod.\"\\n\\nThus is one heat from many embers felt,\\nAs in that image many were the loves,\\nAnd one the voice, that issued from them all.\\nWhence I address them: \"O perennial flowers\\nOf gladness everlasting! that exhale\\nIn single breath your odours manifold!\\nBreathe now; and let the hunger be appeas\\'d,\\nThat with great craving long hath held my soul,\\nFinding no food on earth.  This well I know,\\nThat if there be in heav\\'n a realm, that shows\\nIn faithful mirror the celestial Justice,\\nYours without veil reflects it.  Ye discern\\nThe heed, wherewith I do prepare myself\\nTo hearken; ye the doubt that urges me\\nWith such inveterate craving.\"  Straight I saw,\\nLike to a falcon issuing from the hood,\\nThat rears his head, and claps him with his wings,\\nHis beauty and his eagerness bewraying.\\nSo saw I move that stately sign, with praise\\nOf grace divine inwoven and high song\\nOf inexpressive joy.  \"He,\" it began,\\n\"Who turn\\'d his compass on the world\\'s extreme,\\nAnd in that space so variously hath wrought,\\nBoth openly, and in secret, in such wise\\nCould not through all the universe display\\nImpression of his glory, that the Word\\nOf his omniscience should not still remain\\nIn infinite excess.  In proof whereof,\\nHe first through pride supplanted, who was sum\\nOf each created being, waited not\\nFor light celestial, and abortive fell.\\nWhence needs each lesser nature is but scant\\nReceptacle unto that Good, which knows\\nNo limit, measur\\'d by itself alone.\\nTherefore your sight, of th\\' omnipresent Mind\\nA single beam, its origin must own\\nSurpassing far its utmost potency.\\nThe ken, your world is gifted with, descends\\nIn th\\' everlasting Justice as low down,\\nAs eye doth in the sea; which though it mark\\nThe bottom from the shore, in the wide main\\nDiscerns it not; and ne\\'ertheless it is,\\nBut hidden through its deepness.  Light is none,\\nSave that which cometh from the pure serene\\nOf ne\\'er disturbed ether: for the rest,\\n\\'Tis darkness all, or shadow of the flesh,\\nOr else its poison.

Smiling then,\\nBeatrice spake: \"O life in glory shrin\\'d!\"\\nWho didst the largess of our kingly court\\nSet down with faithful pen! let now thy voice\\nOf hope the praises in this height resound.\\nFor thou, who figur\\'st them in shapes, as clear,\\nAs Jesus stood before thee, well can\\'st speak them.\"\\n\\n\"Lift up thy head, and be thou strong in trust:\\nFor that, which hither from the mortal world\\nArriveth, must be ripen\\'d in our beam.\"\\n\\nSuch cheering accents from the second flame\\nAssur\\'d me; and mine eyes I lifted up\\nUnto the mountains that had bow\\'d them late\\nWith over-heavy burden.  \"Sith our Liege\\nWills of his grace that thou, or ere thy death,\\nIn the most secret council, with his lords\\nShouldst be confronted, so that having view\\'d\\nThe glories of our court, thou mayst therewith\\nThyself, and all who hear, invigorate\\nWith hope, that leads to blissful end; declare,\\nWhat is that hope, how it doth flourish in thee,\\nAnd whence thou hadst it?\"  Thus proceeding still,\\nThe second light: and she, whose gentle love\\nMy soaring pennons in that lofty flight\\nEscorted, thus preventing me, rejoin\\'d:\\nAmong her sons, not one more full of hope,\\nHath the church militant: so \\'t is of him\\nRecorded in the sun, whose liberal orb\\nEnlighteneth all our tribe: and ere his term\\nOf warfare, hence permitted he is come,\\nFrom Egypt to Jerusalem, to see.\\nThe other points, both which thou hast inquir\\'d,\\nNot for more knowledge, but that he may tell\\nHow dear thou holdst the virtue, these to him\\nLeave I; for he may answer thee with ease,\\nAnd without boasting, so God give him grace.\"\\nLike to the scholar, practis\\'d in his task,\\nWho, willing to give proof of diligence,\\nSeconds his teacher gladly, \"Hope,\" said I,\\n\"Is of the joy to come a sure expectance,\\nTh\\' effect of grace divine and merit preceding.\\nThis light from many a star visits my heart,\\nBut flow\\'d to me the first from him, who sang\\nThe songs of the Supreme, himself supreme\\nAmong his tuneful brethren.  \\'Let all hope\\nIn thee,\\' so speak his anthem, \\'who have known\\nThy name;\\' and with my faith who know not that?\\nFrom thee, the next, distilling from his spring,\\nIn thine epistle, fell on me the drops\\nSo plenteously, that I on others shower\\nThe influence of their dew.\"  Whileas I spake,\\nA lamping, as of quick and vollied lightning,\\nWithin the bosom of that mighty sheen,\\nPlay\\'d tremulous; then forth these accents breath\\'d:\\n\"Love for the virtue which attended me\\nE\\'en to the palm, and issuing from the field,\\nGlows vigorous yet within me, and inspires\\nTo ask of thee, whom also it delights;\\nWhat promise thou from hope in chief dost win.\"\\n\\n\"Both scriptures, new and ancient,\" I reply\\'d;\\n\"Propose the mark (which even now I view)\\nFor souls belov\\'d of God.

Amidst them next,\\nA light of so clear amplitude emerg\\'d,\\nThat winter\\'s month were but a single day,\\nWere such a crystal in the Cancer\\'s sign.\\n\\nLike as a virgin riseth up, and goes,\\nAnd enters on the mazes of the dance,\\nThough gay, yet innocent of worse intent,\\nThan to do fitting honour to the bride;\\nSo I beheld the new effulgence come\\nUnto the other two, who in a ring\\nWheel\\'d, as became their rapture.  In the dance\\nAnd in the song it mingled.  And the dame\\nHeld on them fix\\'d her looks: e\\'en as the spouse\\nSilent and moveless.  \"This is he, who lay\\nUpon the bosom of our pelican:\\nThis he, into whose keeping from the cross\\nThe mighty charge was given.\"  Thus she spake,\\nYet therefore naught the more remov\\'d her Sight\\nFrom marking them, or ere her words began,\\nOr when they clos\\'d.  As he, who looks intent,\\nAnd strives with searching ken, how he may see\\nThe sun in his eclipse, and, through desire\\nOf seeing, loseth power of sight: so I\\nPeer\\'d on that last resplendence, while I heard:\\n\"Why dazzlest thou thine eyes in seeking that,\\nWhich here abides not?  Earth my body is,\\nIn earth: and shall be, with the rest, so long,\\nAs till our number equal the decree\\nOf the Most High.  The two that have ascended,\\nIn this our blessed cloister, shine alone\\nWith the two garments.  So report below.\"\\n\\nAs when, for ease of labour, or to shun\\nSuspected peril at a whistle\\'s breath,\\nThe oars, erewhile dash\\'d frequent in the wave,\\nAll rest; the flamy circle at that voice\\nSo rested, and the mingling sound was still,\\nWhich from the trinal band soft-breathing rose.\\nI turn\\'d, but ah! how trembled in my thought,\\nWhen, looking at my side again to see\\nBeatrice, I descried her not, although\\nNot distant, on the happy coast she stood.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXVI\\n\\nWith dazzled eyes, whilst wond\\'ring I remain\\'d,\\nForth of the beamy flame which dazzled me,\\nIssued a breath, that in attention mute\\nDetain\\'d me; and these words it spake: \"\\'T were well,\\nThat, long as till thy vision, on my form\\nO\\'erspent, regain its virtue, with discourse\\nThou compensate the brief delay.  Say then,\\nBeginning, to what point thy soul aspires:\\n\\n\"And meanwhile rest assur\\'d, that sight in thee\\nIs but o\\'erpowered a space, not wholly quench\\'d:\\nSince thy fair guide and lovely, in her look\\nHath potency, the like to that which dwelt\\nIn Ananias\\' hand.\" I answering thus:\\n\"Be to mine eyes the remedy or late\\nOr early, at her pleasure; for they were\\nThe gates, at which she enter\\'d, and did light\\nHer never dying fire.  My wishes here\\nAre centered; in this palace is the weal,\\nThat Alpha and Omega, is to all\\nThe lessons love can read me.\"  Yet again\\nThe voice which had dispers\\'d my fear, when daz\\'d\\nWith that excess, to converse urg\\'d, and spake:\\n\"Behooves thee sift more narrowly thy terms,\\nAnd say, who level\\'d at this scope thy bow.\"\\n\\n\"Philosophy,\" said I, \\'\\'hath arguments,\\nAnd this place hath authority enough\\n\\'T\\' imprint in me such love: for, of constraint,\\nGood, inasmuch as we perceive the good,\\nKindles our love, and in degree the more,\\nAs it comprises more of goodness in \\'t.\\nThe essence then, where such advantage is,\\nThat each good, found without it, is naught else\\nBut of his light the beam, must needs attract\\nThe soul of each one, loving, who the truth\\nDiscerns, on which this proof is built.  Such truth\\nLearn I from him, who shows me the first love\\nOf all intelligential substances\\nEternal: from his voice I learn, whose word\\nIs truth, that of himself to Moses saith,\\n\\'I will make all my good before thee pass.\\'\\nLastly from thee I learn, who chief proclaim\\'st,\\nE\\'en at the outset of thy heralding,\\nIn mortal ears the mystery of heav\\'n.\"\\n\\n\"Through human wisdom, and th\\' authority\\nTherewith agreeing,\" heard I answer\\'d, \"keep\\nThe choicest of thy love for God.  But say,\\nIf thou yet other cords within thee feel\\'st\\nThat draw thee towards him; so that thou report\\nHow many are the fangs, with which this love\\nIs grappled to thy soul.\"  I did not miss,\\nTo what intent the eagle of our Lord\\nHad pointed his demand; yea noted well\\nTh\\' avowal, which he led to; and resum\\'d:\\n\"All grappling bonds, that knit the heart to God,\\nConfederate to make fast our clarity.\\nThe being of the world, and mine own being,\\nThe death which he endur\\'d that I should live,\\nAnd that, which all the faithful hope, as I do,\\nTo the foremention\\'d lively knowledge join\\'d,\\nHave from the sea of ill love sav\\'d my bark,\\nAnd on the coast secur\\'d it of the right.\\nAs for the leaves, that in the garden bloom,\\nMy love for them is great, as is the good\\nDealt by th\\' eternal hand, that tends them all.\"\\n\\nI ended, and therewith a song most sweet\\nRang through the spheres; and \"Holy, holy, holy,\"\\nAccordant with the rest my lady sang.\\nAnd as a sleep is broken and dispers\\'d\\nThrough sharp encounter of the nimble light,\\nWith the eye\\'s spirit running forth to meet\\nThe ray, from membrane on to the membrane urg\\'d;\\nAnd the upstartled wight loathes that he sees;\\nSo, at his sudden waking, he misdeems\\nOf all around him, till assurance waits\\nOn better judgment: thus the saintly came\\nDrove from before mine eyes the motes away,\\nWith the resplendence of her own, that cast\\nTheir brightness downward, thousand miles below.\\nWhence I my vision, clearer shall before,\\nRecover\\'d; and, well nigh astounded, ask\\'d\\nOf a fourth light, that now with us I saw.\\n\\nAnd Beatrice: \"The first diving soul,\\nThat ever the first virtue fram\\'d, admires\\nWithin these rays his Maker.\"  Like the leaf,\\nThat bows its lithe top till the blast is blown;\\nBy its own virtue rear\\'d then stands aloof;\\nSo I, the whilst she said, awe-stricken bow\\'d.\\nThen eagerness to speak embolden\\'d me;\\nAnd I began: \"O fruit! that wast alone\\nMature, when first engender\\'d!  Ancient father!\\nThat doubly seest in every wedded bride\\nThy daughter by affinity and blood!\\nDevoutly as I may, I pray thee hold\\nConverse with me: my will thou seest; and I,\\nMore speedily to hear thee, tell it not.\"\\n\\nIt chanceth oft some animal bewrays,\\nThrough the sleek cov\\'ring of his furry coat.\\nThe fondness, that stirs in him and conforms\\nHis outside seeming to the cheer within:\\nAnd in like guise was Adam\\'s spirit mov\\'d\\nTo joyous mood, that through the covering shone,\\nTransparent, when to pleasure me it spake:\\n\"No need thy will be told, which I untold\\nBetter discern, than thou whatever thing\\nThou holdst most certain: for that will I see\\nIn Him, who is truth\\'s mirror, and Himself\\nParhelion unto all things, and naught else\\nTo him.  This wouldst thou hear; how long since God\\nPlac\\'d me high garden, from whose hounds\\nShe led me up in this ladder, steep and long;\\nWhat space endur\\'d my season of delight;\\nWhence truly sprang the wrath that banish\\'d me;\\nAnd what the language, which I spake and fram\\'d\\nNot that I tasted of the tree, my son,\\nWas in itself the cause of that exile,\\nBut only my transgressing of the mark\\nAssign\\'d me.  There, whence at thy lady\\'s hest\\nThe Mantuan mov\\'d him, still was I debarr\\'d\\nThis council, till the sun had made complete,\\nFour thousand and three hundred rounds and twice,\\nHis annual journey; and, through every light\\nIn his broad pathway, saw I him return,\\nThousand save sev\\'nty times, the whilst I dwelt\\nUpon the earth.  The language I did use\\nWas worn away, or ever Nimrod\\'s race\\nTheir unaccomplishable work began.\\nFor naught, that man inclines to, ere was lasting,\\nLeft by his reason free, and variable,\\nAs is the sky that sways him.  That he speaks,\\nIs nature\\'s prompting: whether thus or thus,\\nShe leaves to you, as ye do most affect it.\\nEre I descended into hell\\'s abyss,\\nEl was the name on earth of the Chief Good,\\nWhose joy enfolds me: Eli then \\'t was call\\'d\\nAnd so beseemeth: for, in mortals, use\\nIs as the leaf upon the bough; that goes,\\nAnd other comes instead.  Upon the mount\\nMost high above the waters, all my life,\\nBoth innocent and guilty, did but reach\\nFrom the first hour, to that which cometh next\\n(As the sun changes quarter), to the sixth.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXVII\\n\\nThen  \"Glory to the Father, to the Son,\\nAnd to the Holy Spirit,\" rang aloud\\nThroughout all Paradise, that with the song\\nMy spirit reel\\'d, so passing sweet the strain:\\nAnd what I saw was equal ecstasy;\\nOne universal smile it seem\\'d of all things,\\nJoy past compare, gladness unutterable,\\nImperishable life of peace and love,\\nExhaustless riches and unmeasur\\'d bliss.\\n\\nBefore mine eyes stood the four torches lit;\\nAnd that, which first had come, began to wax\\nIn brightness, and in semblance such became,\\nAs Jove might be, if he and Mars were birds,\\nAnd interchang\\'d their plumes.  Silence ensued,\\nThrough the blest quire, by Him, who here appoints\\nVicissitude of ministry, enjoin\\'d;\\nWhen thus I heard: \"Wonder not, if my hue\\nBe chang\\'d; for, while I speak, these shalt thou see\\nAll in like manner change with me.  My place\\nHe who usurps on earth (my place, ay, mine,\\nWhich in the presence of the Son of God\\nIs void), the same hath made my cemetery\\nA common sewer of puddle and of blood:\\nThe more below his triumph, who from hence\\nMalignant fell.\"  Such colour, as the sun,\\nAt eve or morning, paints an adverse cloud,\\nThen saw I sprinkled over all the sky.\\nAnd as th\\' unblemish\\'d dame, who in herself\\nSecure of censure, yet at bare report\\nOf other\\'s failing, shrinks with maiden fear;\\nSo Beatrice in her semblance chang\\'d:\\nAnd such eclipse in heav\\'n methinks was seen,\\nWhen the Most Holy suffer\\'d.  Then the words\\nProceeded, with voice, alter\\'d from itself\\nSo clean, the semblance did not alter more.\\n\"Not to this end was Christ\\'s spouse with my blood,\\nWith that of Linus, and of Cletus fed:\\nThat she might serve for purchase of base gold:\\nBut for the purchase of this happy life\\nDid Sextus, Pius, and Callixtus bleed,\\nAnd Urban, they, whose doom was not without\\nMuch weeping seal\\'d.  No purpose was of our\\nThat on the right hand of our successors\\nPart of the Christian people should be set,\\nAnd part upon their left; nor that the keys,\\nWhich were vouchsaf\\'d me, should for ensign serve\\nUnto the banners, that do levy war\\nOn the baptiz\\'d: nor I, for sigil-mark\\nSet upon sold and lying privileges;\\nWhich makes me oft to bicker and turn red.\\nIn shepherd\\'s clothing greedy wolves below\\nRange wide o\\'er all the pastures.  Arm of God!\\nWhy longer sleepst thou?  Caorsines and Gascona\\nPrepare to quaff our blood.  O good beginning\\nTo what a vile conclusion must thou stoop!\\nBut the high providence, which did defend\\nThrough Scipio the world\\'s glory unto Rome,\\nWill not delay its succour: and thou, son,\\nWho through thy mortal weight shall yet again\\nReturn below, open thy lips, nor hide\\nWhat is by me not hidden.\"  As a Hood\\nOf frozen vapours streams adown the air,\\nWhat time the she-goat with her skiey horn\\nTouches the sun; so saw I there stream wide\\nThe vapours, who with us had linger\\'d late\\nAnd with glad triumph deck th\\' ethereal cope.\\nOnward my sight their semblances pursued;\\nSo far pursued, as till the space between\\nFrom its reach sever\\'d them: whereat the guide\\nCelestial, marking me no more intent\\nOn upward gazing, said, \"Look down and see\\nWhat circuit thou hast compass\\'d.\"  From the hour\\nWhen I before had cast my view beneath,\\nAll the first region overpast I saw,\\nWhich from the midmost to the bound\\'ry winds;\\nThat onward thence from Gades I beheld\\nThe unwise passage of Laertes\\' son,\\nAnd hitherward the shore, where thou, Europa!\\nMad\\'st thee a joyful burden: and yet more\\nOf this dim spot had seen, but that the sun,\\nA constellation off and more, had ta\\'en\\nHis progress in the zodiac underneath.\\n\\nThen by the spirit, that doth never leave\\nIts amorous dalliance with my lady\\'s looks,\\nBack with redoubled ardour were mine eyes\\nLed unto her: and from her radiant smiles,\\nWhenas I turn\\'d me, pleasure so divine\\nDid lighten on me, that whatever bait\\nOr art or nature in the human flesh,\\nOr in its limn\\'d resemblance, can combine\\nThrough greedy eyes to take the soul withal,\\nWere to her beauty nothing.  Its boon influence\\nFrom the fair nest of Leda rapt me forth,\\nAnd wafted on into the swiftest heav\\'n.\\n\\nWhat place for entrance Beatrice chose,\\nI may not say, so uniform was all,\\nLiveliest and loftiest.  She my secret wish\\nDivin\\'d; and with such gladness, that God\\'s love\\nSeem\\'d from her visage shining, thus began:\\n\"Here is the goal, whence motion on his race\\nStarts; motionless the centre, and the rest\\nAll mov\\'d around.  Except the soul divine,\\nPlace in this heav\\'n is none, the soul divine,\\nWherein the love, which ruleth o\\'er its orb,\\nIs kindled, and the virtue that it sheds;\\nOne circle, light and love, enclasping it,\\nAs this doth clasp the others; and to Him,\\nWho draws the bound, its limit only known.\\nMeasur\\'d itself by none, it doth divide\\nMotion to all, counted unto them forth,\\nAs by the fifth or half ye count forth ten.\\nThe vase, wherein time\\'s roots are plung\\'d, thou seest,\\nLook elsewhere for the leaves.  O mortal lust!\\nThat canst not lift thy head above the waves\\nWhich whelm and sink thee down!  The will in man\\nBears goodly blossoms; but its ruddy promise\\nIs, by the dripping of perpetual rain,\\nMade mere abortion: faith and innocence\\nAre met with but in babes, each taking leave\\nEre cheeks with down are sprinkled; he, that fasts,\\nWhile yet a stammerer, with his tongue let loose\\nGluts every food alike in every moon.\\nOne yet a babbler, loves and listens to\\nHis mother; but no sooner hath free use\\nOf speech, than he doth wish her in her grave.\\nSo suddenly doth the fair child of him,\\nWhose welcome is the morn and eve his parting,\\nTo negro blackness change her virgin white.\\n\\n\"Thou, to abate thy wonder, note that none\\nBears rule in earth, and its frail family\\nAre therefore wand\\'rers.

As I turn\\'d;\\nAnd that, which, in their circles, none who spies,\\nCan miss of, in itself apparent, struck\\nOn mine; a point I saw, that darted light\\nSo sharp, no lid, unclosing, may bear up\\nAgainst its keenness.  The least star we view\\nFrom hence, had seem\\'d a moon, set by its side,\\nAs star by side of star.  And so far off,\\nPerchance, as is the halo from the light\\nWhich paints it, when most dense the vapour spreads,\\nThere wheel\\'d about the point a circle of fire,\\nMore rapid than the motion, which first girds\\nThe world.  Then, circle after circle, round\\nEnring\\'d each other; till the seventh reach\\'d\\nCircumference so ample, that its bow,\\nWithin the span of Juno\\'s messenger,\\nlied scarce been held entire. Beyond the sev\\'nth,\\nFollow\\'d yet other two.  And every one,\\nAs more in number distant from the first,\\nWas tardier in motion; and that glow\\'d\\nWith flame most pure, that to the sparkle\\' of truth\\nWas nearest, as partaking most, methinks,\\nOf its reality.  The guide belov\\'d\\nSaw me in anxious thought suspense, and spake:\\n\"Heav\\'n, and all nature, hangs upon that point.\\nThe circle thereto most conjoin\\'d observe;\\nAnd know, that by intenser love its course\\nIs to this swiftness wing\\'d.\"  To whom I thus:\\n\"It were enough; nor should I further seek,\\nHad I but witness\\'d order, in the world\\nAppointed, such as in these wheels is seen.\\nBut in the sensible world such diff\\'rence is,\\nThat is each round shows more divinity,\\nAs each is wider from the centre.

A smile\\nBat painted on her cheek; and her fix\\'d gaze\\nBent on the point, at which my vision fail\\'d:\\nWhen thus her words resuming she began:\\n\"I speak, nor what thou wouldst inquire demand;\\nFor I have mark\\'d it, where all time and place\\nAre present.

And, near unto the other, rests\\nThe leader, under whom on manna fed\\nTh\\' ungrateful nation, fickle and perverse.\\nOn th\\' other part, facing to Peter, lo!\\nWhere Anna sits, so well content to look\\nOn her lov\\'d daughter, that with moveless eye\\nShe chants the loud hosanna: while, oppos\\'d\\nTo the first father of your mortal kind,\\nIs Lucia, at whose hest thy lady sped,\\nWhen on the edge of ruin clos\\'d thine eye.\\n\\n\"But (for the vision hasteneth so an end)\\nHere break we off, as the good workman doth,\\nThat shapes the cloak according to the cloth:\\nAnd to the primal love our ken shall rise;\\nThat thou mayst penetrate the brightness, far\\nAs sight can bear thee.  Yet, alas! in sooth\\nBeating thy pennons, thinking to advance,\\nThou backward fall\\'st.  Grace then must first be gain\\'d;\\nHer grace, whose might can help thee.  Thou in prayer\\nSeek her: and, with affection, whilst I sue,\\nAttend, and yield me all thy heart.\"  He said,\\nAnd thus the saintly orison began.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXXIII\\n\\n\"O virgin mother, daughter of thy Son,\\nCreated beings all in lowliness\\nSurpassing, as in height, above them all,\\nTerm by th\\' eternal counsel pre-ordain\\'d,\\nEnnobler of thy nature, so advanc\\'d\\nIn thee, that its great Maker did not scorn,\\nHimself, in his own work enclos\\'d to dwell!\\nFor in thy womb rekindling shone the love\\nReveal\\'d, whose genial influence makes now\\nThis flower to germin in eternal peace!\\nHere thou to us, of charity and love,\\nArt, as the noon-day torch: and art, beneath,\\nTo mortal men, of hope a living spring.\\nSo mighty art thou, lady! and so great,\\nThat he who grace desireth, and comes not\\nTo thee for aidance, fain would have desire\\nFly without wings.  Nor only him who asks,\\nThy bounty succours, but doth freely oft\\nForerun the asking.  Whatsoe\\'er may be\\nOf excellence in creature, pity mild,\\nRelenting mercy, large munificence,\\nAre all combin\\'d in thee.  Here kneeleth one,\\nWho of all spirits hath review\\'d the state,\\nFrom the world\\'s lowest gap unto this height.\\nSuppliant to thee he kneels, imploring grace\\nFor virtue, yet more high to lift his ken\\nToward the bliss supreme.  And I, who ne\\'er\\nCoveted sight, more fondly, for myself,\\nThan now for him, my prayers to thee prefer,\\n(And pray they be not scant) that thou wouldst drive\\nEach cloud of his mortality away;\\nThat on the sovran pleasure he may gaze.\\nThis also I entreat of thee, O queen!\\nWho canst do what thou wilt! that in him thou\\nWouldst after all he hath beheld, preserve\\nAffection sound, and human passions quell.\\nLo!

I, meanwhile, who drew\\nNear to the limit, where all wishes end,\\nThe ardour of my wish (for so behooved),\\nEnded within me. Beck\\'ning smil\\'d the sage,\\nThat I should look aloft: but, ere he bade,\\nAlready of myself aloft I look\\'d;\\nFor visual strength, refining more and more,\\nBare me into the ray authentical\\nOf sovran light.  Thenceforward, what I saw,\\nWas not for words to speak, nor memory\\'s self\\nTo stand against such outrage on her skill.\\nAs one, who from a dream awaken\\'d, straight,\\nAll he hath seen forgets; yet still retains\\nImpression of the feeling in his dream;\\nE\\'en such am I: for all the vision dies,\\nAs \\'t were, away; and yet the sense of sweet,\\nThat sprang from it, still trickles in my heart.\\nThus in the sun-thaw is the snow unseal\\'d;\\nThus in the winds on flitting leaves was lost\\nThe Sybil\\'s sentence.  O eternal beam!\\n(Whose height what reach of mortal thought may soar?)\\nYield me again some little particle\\nOf what thou then appearedst, give my tongue\\nPower, but to leave one sparkle of thy glory,\\nUnto the race to come, that shall not lose\\nThy triumph wholly, if thou waken aught\\nOf memory in me, and endure to hear\\nThe record sound in this unequal strain.\\n\\nSuch keenness from the living ray I met,\\nThat, if mine eyes had turn\\'d away, methinks,\\nI had been lost; but, so embolden\\'d, on\\nI pass\\'d, as I remember, till my view\\nHover\\'d the brink of dread infinitude.\\n\\nO grace! unenvying of thy boon! that gav\\'st\\nBoldness to fix so earnestly my ken\\nOn th\\' everlasting splendour, that I look\\'d,\\nWhile sight was unconsum\\'d, and, in that depth,\\nSaw in one volume clasp\\'d of love, whatever\\nThe universe unfolds; all properties\\nOf substance and of accident, beheld,\\nCompounded, yet one individual light\\nThe whole.  And of such bond methinks I saw\\nThe universal form: for that whenever\\nI do but speak of it, my soul dilates\\nBeyond her proper self; and, till I speak,\\nOne moment seems a longer lethargy,\\nThan five-and-twenty ages had appear\\'d\\nTo that emprize, that first made Neptune wonder\\nAt Argo\\'s shadow darkening on his flood.\\n\\nWith fixed heed, suspense and motionless,\\nWond\\'ring I gaz\\'d; and admiration still\\nWas kindled, as I gaz\\'d.  It may not be,\\nThat one, who looks upon that light, can turn\\nTo other object, willingly, his view.\\nFor all the good, that will may covet, there\\nIs summ\\'d; and all, elsewhere defective found,\\nComplete.  My tongue shall utter now, no more\\nE\\'en what remembrance keeps, than could the babe\\'s\\nThat yet is moisten\\'d at his mother\\'s breast.\\nNot that the semblance of the living light\\nWas chang\\'d (that ever as at first remain\\'d)\\nBut that my vision quickening, in that sole\\nAppearance, still new miracles descry\\'d,\\nAnd toil\\'d me with the change.  In that abyss\\nOf radiance, clear and lofty, seem\\'d methought,\\nThree orbs of triple hue clipt in one bound:\\nAnd, from another, one reflected seem\\'d,\\nAs rainbow is from rainbow: and the third\\nSeem\\'d fire, breath\\'d equally from both.  Oh speech\\nHow feeble and how faint art thou, to give\\nConception birth!  Yet this to what I saw\\nIs less than little.  Oh eternal light!\\nSole in thyself that dwellst; and of thyself\\nSole understood, past, present, or to come!\\nThou smiledst; on that circling, which in thee\\nSeem\\'d as reflected splendour, while I mus\\'d;\\nFor I therein, methought, in its own hue\\nBeheld our image painted: steadfastly\\nI therefore por\\'d upon the view.  As one\\nWho vers\\'d in geometric lore, would fain\\nMeasure the circle; and, though pondering long\\nAnd deeply, that beginning, which he needs,\\nFinds not; e\\'en such was I, intent to scan\\nThe novel wonder, and trace out the form,\\nHow to the circle fitted, and therein\\nHow plac\\'d: but the flight was not for my wing;\\nHad not a flash darted athwart my mind,\\nAnd in the spleen unfolded what it sought.\\n\\nHere vigour fail\\'d the tow\\'ring fantasy:\\nBut yet the will roll\\'d onward, like a wheel\\nIn even motion, by the Love impell\\'d,\\nThat moves the sun in heav\\'n and all the stars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE VISION\\n\\nOF\\n\\nPURGATORY\\n\\nBY DANTE ALIGHIERI\\n\\n\\nComplete\\n\\n\\n\\nTRANSLATED BY\\n\\nTHE REV.

Heaven of their rays\\nSeem\\'d joyous.  O thou northern site, bereft\\nIndeed, and widow\\'d, since of these depriv\\'d!\\n\\nAs from this view I had desisted, straight\\nTurning a little tow\\'rds the other pole,\\nThere from whence now the wain had disappear\\'d,\\nI saw an old man standing by my side\\nAlone, so worthy of rev\\'rence in his look,\\nThat ne\\'er from son to father more was ow\\'d.\\nLow down his beard and mix\\'d with hoary white\\nDescended, like his locks, which parting fell\\nUpon his breast in double fold.  The beams\\nOf those four luminaries on his face\\nSo brightly shone, and with such radiance clear\\nDeck\\'d it, that I beheld him as the sun.\\n\\n\"Say who are ye, that stemming the blind stream,\\nForth from th\\' eternal prison-house have fled?\"\\nHe spoke and moved those venerable plumes.\\n\"Who hath conducted, or with lantern sure\\nLights you emerging from the depth of night,\\nThat makes the infernal valley ever black?\\nAre the firm statutes of the dread abyss\\nBroken, or in high heaven new laws ordain\\'d,\\nThat thus, condemn\\'d, ye to my caves approach?\"\\n\\nMy guide, then laying hold on me, by words\\nAnd intimations given with hand and head,\\nMade my bent knees and eye submissive pay\\nDue reverence; then thus to him replied.\\n\\n\"Not of myself I come; a Dame from heaven\\nDescending, had besought me in my charge\\nTo bring.  But since thy will implies, that more\\nOur true condition I unfold at large,\\nMine is not to deny thee thy request.\\nThis mortal ne\\'er hath seen the farthest gloom.\\nBut erring by his folly had approach\\'d\\nSo near, that little space was left to turn.\\nThen, as before I told, I was dispatch\\'d\\nTo work his rescue, and no way remain\\'d\\nSave this which I have ta\\'en.  I have display\\'d\\nBefore him all the regions of the bad;\\nAnd purpose now those spirits to display,\\nThat under thy command are purg\\'d from sin.\\nHow I have brought him would be long to say.\\nFrom high descends the virtue, by whose aid\\nI to thy sight and hearing him have led.\\nNow may our coming please thee.  In the search\\nOf liberty he journeys: that how dear\\nThey know, who for her sake have life refus\\'d.\\nThou knowest, to whom death for her was sweet\\nIn Utica, where thou didst leave those weeds,\\nThat in the last great day will shine so bright.\\nFor us the\\' eternal edicts are unmov\\'d:\\nHe breathes, and I am free of Minos\\' power,\\nAbiding in that circle where the eyes\\nOf thy chaste Marcia beam, who still in look\\nPrays thee, O hallow\\'d spirit! to own her shine.\\nThen by her love we\\' implore thee, let us pass\\nThrough thy sev\\'n regions; for which best thanks\\nI for thy favour will to her return,\\nIf mention there below thou not disdain.\"\\n\\n\"Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found,\"\\nHe then to him rejoin\\'d, \"while I was there,\\nThat all she ask\\'d me I was fain to grant.\\nNow that beyond the\\' accursed stream she dwells,\\nShe may no longer move me, by that law,\\nWhich was ordain\\'d me, when I issued thence.\\nNot so, if Dame from heaven, as thou sayst,\\nMoves and directs thee; then no flattery needs.\\nEnough for me that in her name thou ask.\\nGo therefore now: and with a slender reed\\nSee that thou duly gird him, and his face\\nLave, till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence.\\nFor not with eye, by any cloud obscur\\'d,\\nWould it be seemly before him to come,\\nWho stands the foremost minister in heaven.\\nThis islet all around, there far beneath,\\nWhere the wave beats it, on the oozy bed\\nProduces store of reeds. No other plant,\\nCover\\'d with leaves, or harden\\'d in its stalk,\\nThere lives, not bending to the water\\'s sway.\\nAfter, this way return not; but the sun\\nWill show you, that now rises, where to take\\nThe mountain in its easiest ascent.\"\\n\\nHe disappear\\'d; and I myself uprais\\'d\\nSpeechless, and to my guide retiring close,\\nToward him turn\\'d mine eyes.  He thus began;\\n\"My son! observant thou my steps pursue.\\nWe must retreat to rearward, for that way\\nThe champain to its low extreme declines.\"\\n\\nThe dawn had chas\\'d the matin hour of prime,\\nWhich deaf before it, so that from afar\\nI spy\\'d the trembling of the ocean stream.\\n\\nWe travers\\'d the deserted plain, as one\\nWho, wander\\'d from his track, thinks every step\\nTrodden in vain till he regain the path.\\n\\nWhen we had come, where yet the tender dew\\nStrove with the sun, and in a place, where fresh\\nThe wind breath\\'d o\\'er it, while it slowly dried;\\nBoth hands extended on the watery grass\\nMy master plac\\'d, in graceful act and kind.\\nWhence I of his intent before appriz\\'d,\\nStretch\\'d out to him my cheeks suffus\\'d with tears.\\nThere to my visage he anew restor\\'d\\nThat hue, which the dun shades of hell conceal\\'d.\\n\\nThen on the solitary shore arriv\\'d,\\nThat never sailing on its waters saw\\nMan, that could after measure back his course,\\nHe girt me in such manner as had pleas\\'d\\nHim who instructed, and O, strange to tell!\\nAs he selected every humble plant,\\nWherever one was pluck\\'d, another there\\nResembling, straightway in its place arose.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO II\\n\\nNow had the sun to that horizon reach\\'d,\\nThat covers, with the most exalted point\\nOf its meridian circle, Salem\\'s walls,\\nAnd night, that opposite to him her orb\\nSounds, from the stream of Ganges issued forth,\\nHolding the scales, that from her hands are dropp\\'d\\nWhen she reigns highest: so that where I was,\\nAurora\\'s white and vermeil-tinctur\\'d cheek\\nTo orange turn\\'d as she in age increas\\'d.\\n\\nMeanwhile we linger\\'d by the water\\'s brink,\\nLike men, who, musing on their road, in thought\\nJourney, while motionless the body rests.\\nWhen lo! as near upon the hour of dawn,\\nThrough the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam\\nGlares down in west, over the ocean floor;\\nSo seem\\'d, what once again I hope to view,\\nA light so swiftly coming through the sea,\\nNo winged course might equal its career.\\nFrom which when for a space I had withdrawn\\nThine eyes, to make inquiry of my guide,\\nAgain I look\\'d and saw it grown in size\\nAnd brightness: thou on either side appear\\'d\\nSomething, but what I knew not of bright hue,\\nAnd by degrees from underneath it came\\nAnother.  My preceptor silent yet\\nStood, while the brightness, that we first discern\\'d,\\nOpen\\'d the form of wings: then when he knew\\nThe pilot, cried aloud, \"Down, down; bend low\\nThy knees; behold God\\'s angel: fold thy hands:\\nNow shalt thou see true Ministers indeed.\\n\\n\"Lo how all human means he sets at naught!\\nSo that nor oar he needs, nor other sail\\nExcept his wings, between such distant shores.\\nLo how straight up to heaven he holds them rear\\'d,\\nWinnowing the air with those eternal plumes,\\nThat not like mortal hairs fall off or change!\"\\n\\nAs more and more toward us came, more bright\\nAppear\\'d the bird of God, nor could the eye\\nEndure his splendor near: I mine bent down.\\nHe drove ashore in a small bark so swift\\nAnd light, that in its course no wave it drank.\\nThe heav\\'nly steersman at the prow was seen,\\nVisibly written blessed in his looks.\\n\\nWithin a hundred spirits and more there sat.\\n\"In Exitu Israel de Aegypto;\"\\nAll with one voice together sang, with what\\nIn the remainder of that hymn is writ.\\nThen soon as with the sign of holy cross\\nHe bless\\'d them, they at once leap\\'d out on land,\\nThe swiftly as he came return\\'d. The crew,\\nThere left, appear\\'d astounded with the place,\\nGazing around as one who sees new sights.\\n\\nFrom every side the sun darted his beams,\\nAnd with his arrowy radiance from mid heav\\'n\\nHad chas\\'d the Capricorn, when that strange tribe\\nLifting their eyes towards us: \"If ye know,\\nDeclare what path will Lead us to the mount.\"\\n\\nThem Virgil answer\\'d.  \"Ye suppose perchance\\nUs well acquainted with this place: but here,\\nWe, as yourselves, are strangers.  Not long erst\\nWe came, before you but a little space,\\nBy other road so rough and hard, that now\\nThe\\' ascent will seem to us as play.\"  The spirits,\\nWho from my breathing had perceiv\\'d I liv\\'d,\\nGrew pale with wonder.  As the multitude\\nFlock round a herald, sent with olive branch,\\nTo hear what news he brings, and in their haste\\nTread one another down, e\\'en so at sight\\nOf me those happy spirits were fix\\'d, each one\\nForgetful of its errand, to depart,\\nWhere cleans\\'d from sin, it might be made all fair.\\n\\nThen one I saw darting before the rest\\nWith such fond ardour to embrace me, I\\nTo do the like was mov\\'d.  O shadows vain\\nExcept in outward semblance! thrice my hands\\nI clasp\\'d behind it, they as oft return\\'d\\nEmpty into my breast again.  Surprise\\nI needs must think was painted in my looks,\\nFor that the shadow smil\\'d and backward drew.\\nTo follow it I hasten\\'d, but with voice\\nOf sweetness it enjoin\\'d me to desist.\\nThen who it was I knew, and pray\\'d of it,\\nTo talk with me, it would a little pause.\\nIt answered: \"Thee as in my mortal frame\\nI lov\\'d, so loos\\'d forth it I love thee still,\\nAnd therefore pause; but why walkest thou here?\"\\n\\n\"Not without purpose once more to return,\\nThou find\\'st me, my Casella, where I am\\nJourneying this way;\" I said, \"but how of thee\\nHath so much time been lost?\"  He answer\\'d straight:\\n\"No outrage hath been done to me, if he\\nWho when and whom he chooses takes, me oft\\nThis passage hath denied, since of just will\\nHis will he makes.  These three months past indeed,\\nHe, whose chose to enter, with free leave\\nHath taken; whence I wand\\'ring by the shore\\nWhere Tyber\\'s wave grows salt, of him gain\\'d kind\\nAdmittance, at that river\\'s mouth, tow\\'rd which\\nHis wings are pointed, for there always throng\\nAll such as not to Archeron descend.\"\\n\\nThen I: \"If new laws have not quite destroy\\'d\\nMemory and use of that sweet song of love,\\nThat while all my cares had power to \\'swage;\\nPlease thee with it a little to console\\nMy spirit, that incumber\\'d with its frame,\\nTravelling so far, of pain is overcome.\"\\n\\n\"Love that discourses in my thoughts.\"  He then\\nBegan in such soft accents, that within\\nThe sweetness thrills me yet.  My gentle guide\\nAnd all who came with him, so well were pleas\\'d,\\nThat seem\\'d naught else might in their thoughts have room.\\n\\nFast fix\\'d in mute attention to his notes\\nWe stood, when lo! that old man venerable\\nExclaiming, \"How is this, ye tardy spirits?\\nWhat negligence detains you loit\\'ring here?\\nRun to the mountain to cast off those scales,\\nThat from your eyes the sight of God conceal.\"\\n\\nAs a wild flock of pigeons, to their food\\nCollected, blade or tares, without their pride\\nAccustom\\'d, and in still and quiet sort,\\nIf aught alarm them, suddenly desert\\nTheir meal, assail\\'d by more important care;\\nSo I that new-come troop beheld, the song\\nDeserting, hasten to the mountain\\'s side,\\nAs one who goes yet where he tends knows not.\\n\\nNor with less hurried step did we depart.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO III\\n\\nThem sudden flight had scatter\\'d over the plain,\\nTurn\\'d tow\\'rds the mountain, whither reason\\'s voice\\nDrives us; I to my faithful company\\nAdhering, left it not.  For how of him\\nDepriv\\'d, might I have sped, or who beside\\nWould o\\'er the mountainous tract have led my steps\\nHe with the bitter pang of self-remorse\\nSeem\\'d smitten.  O clear conscience and upright\\nHow doth a little fling wound thee sore!\\n\\nSoon as his feet desisted (slack\\'ning pace),\\nFrom haste, that mars all decency of act,\\nMy mind, that in itself before was wrapt,\\nIts thoughts expanded, as with joy restor\\'d:\\nAnd full against the steep ascent I set\\nMy face, where highest to heav\\'n its top o\\'erflows.\\n\\nThe sun, that flar\\'d behind, with ruddy beam\\nBefore my form was broken; for in me\\nHis rays resistance met.  I turn\\'d aside\\nWith fear of being left, when I beheld\\nOnly before myself the ground obscur\\'d.\\nWhen thus my solace, turning him around,\\nBespake me kindly: \"Why distrustest thou?\\nBeliev\\'st not I am with thee, thy sure guide?\\nIt now is evening there, where buried lies\\nThe body, in which I cast a shade, remov\\'d\\nTo Naples from Brundusium\\'s wall.  Nor thou\\nMarvel, if before me no shadow fall,\\nMore than that in the sky element\\nOne ray obstructs not other.  To endure\\nTorments of heat and cold extreme, like frames\\nThat virtue hath dispos\\'d, which how it works\\nWills not to us should be reveal\\'d.  Insane\\nWho hopes, our reason may that space explore,\\nWhich holds three persons in one substance knit.\\nSeek not the wherefore, race of human kind;\\nCould ye have seen the whole, no need had been\\nFor Mary to bring forth.  Moreover ye\\nHave seen such men desiring fruitlessly;\\nTo whose desires repose would have been giv\\'n,\\nThat now but serve them for eternal grief.\\nI speak of Plato, and the Stagyrite,\\nAnd others many more.\"  And then he bent\\nDownwards his forehead, and in troubled mood\\nBroke off his speech.  Meanwhile we had arriv\\'d\\nFar as the mountain\\'s foot, and there the rock\\nFound of so steep ascent, that nimblest steps\\nTo climb it had been vain.  The most remote\\nMost wild untrodden path, in all the tract\\n\\'Twixt Lerice and Turbia were to this\\nA ladder easy\\' and open of access.\\n\\n\"Who knows on which hand now the steep declines?\"\\nMy master said and paus\\'d, \"so that he may\\nAscend, who journeys without aid of wine?\"\\nAnd while with looks directed to the ground\\nThe meaning of the pathway he explor\\'d,\\nAnd I gaz\\'d upward round the stony height,\\nOf spirits, that toward us mov\\'d their steps,\\nYet moving seem\\'d not, they so slow approach\\'d.\\n\\nI thus my guide address\\'d: \"Upraise thine eyes,\\nLo that way some, of whom thou may\\'st obtain\\nCounsel, if of thyself thou find\\'st it not!\"\\n\\nStraightway he look\\'d, and with free speech replied:\\n\"Let us tend thither: they but softly come.\\nAnd thou be firm in hope, my son belov\\'d.\"\\n\\nNow was that people distant far in space\\nA thousand paces behind ours, as much\\nAs at a throw the nervous arm could fling,\\nWhen all drew backward on the messy crags\\nOf the steep bank, and firmly stood unmov\\'d\\nAs one who walks in doubt might stand to look.\\n\\n\"O spirits perfect!  O already chosen!\"\\nVirgil to them began, \"by that blest peace,\\nWhich, as I deem, is for you all prepar\\'d,\\nInstruct us where the mountain low declines,\\nSo that attempt to mount it be not vain.\\nFor who knows most, him loss of time most grieves.\"\\n\\nAs sheep, that step from forth their fold, by one,\\nOr pairs, or three at once; meanwhile the rest\\nStand fearfully, bending the eye and nose\\nTo ground, and what the foremost does, that do\\nThe others, gath\\'ring round her, if she stops,\\nSimple and quiet, nor the cause discern;\\nSo saw I moving to advance the first,\\nWho of that fortunate crew were at the head,\\nOf modest mien and graceful in their gait.\\nWhen they before me had beheld the light\\nFrom my right side fall broken on the ground,\\nSo that the shadow reach\\'d the cave, they stopp\\'d\\nAnd somewhat back retir\\'d: the same did all,\\nWho follow\\'d, though unweeting of the cause.\\n\\n\"Unask\\'d of you, yet freely I confess,\\nThis is a human body which ye see.\\nThat the sun\\'s light is broken on the ground,\\nMarvel not: but believe, that not without\\nVirtue deriv\\'d from Heaven, we to climb\\nOver this wall aspire.\"  So them bespake\\nMy master; and that virtuous tribe rejoin\\'d;\\n\"Turn, and before you there the entrance lies,\"\\nMaking a signal to us with bent hands.\\n\\nThen of them one began.  \"Whoe\\'er thou art,\\nWho journey\\'st thus this way, thy visage turn,\\nThink if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen.\"\\n\\nI tow\\'rds him turn\\'d, and with fix\\'d eye beheld.\\nComely, and fair, and gentle of aspect,\\nHe seem\\'d, but on one brow a gash was mark\\'d.\\n\\nWhen humbly I disclaim\\'d to have beheld\\nHim ever: \"Now behold!\"  he said, and show\\'d\\nHigh on his breast a wound: then smiling spake.\\n\\n\"I am Manfredi, grandson to the Queen\\nCostanza: whence I pray thee, when return\\'d,\\nTo my fair daughter go, the parent glad\\nOf Aragonia and Sicilia\\'s pride;\\nAnd of the truth inform her, if of me\\nAught else be told.  When by two mortal blows\\nMy frame was shatter\\'d, I betook myself\\nWeeping to him, who of free will forgives.\\nMy sins were horrible; but so wide arms\\nHath goodness infinite, that it receives\\nAll who turn to it.  Had this text divine\\nBeen of Cosenza\\'s shepherd better scann\\'d,\\nWho then by Clement on my hunt was set,\\nYet at the bridge\\'s head my bones had lain,\\nNear Benevento, by the heavy mole\\nProtected; but the rain now drenches them,\\nAnd the wind drives, out of the kingdom\\'s bounds,\\nFar as the stream of Verde, where, with lights\\nExtinguish\\'d, he remov\\'d them from their bed.\\nYet by their curse we are not so destroy\\'d,\\nBut that the eternal love may turn, while hope\\nRetains her verdant blossoms.  True it is,\\nThat such one as in contumacy dies\\nAgainst the holy church, though he repent,\\nMust wander thirty-fold for all the time\\nIn his presumption past; if such decree\\nBe not by prayers of good men shorter made\\nLook therefore if thou canst advance my bliss;\\nRevealing to my good Costanza, how\\nThou hast beheld me, and beside the terms\\nLaid on me of that interdict; for here\\nBy means of those below much profit comes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO IV\\n\\nWhen by sensations of delight or pain,\\nThat any of our faculties hath seiz\\'d,\\nEntire the soul collects herself, it seems\\nShe is intent upon that power alone,\\nAnd thus the error is disprov\\'d which holds\\nThe soul not singly lighted in the breast.\\nAnd therefore when as aught is heard or seen,\\nThat firmly keeps the soul toward it turn\\'d,\\nTime passes, and a man perceives it not.\\nFor that, whereby he hearken, is one power,\\nAnother that, which the whole spirit hash;\\nThis is as it were bound, while that is free.\\n\\nThis found I true by proof, hearing that spirit\\nAnd wond\\'ring; for full fifty steps aloft\\nThe sun had measur\\'d unobserv\\'d of me,\\nWhen we arriv\\'d where all with one accord\\nThe spirits shouted, \"Here is what ye ask.\"\\n\\nA larger aperture ofttimes is stopp\\'d\\nWith forked stake of thorn by villager,\\nWhen the ripe grape imbrowns, than was the path,\\nBy which my guide, and I behind him close,\\nAscended solitary, when that troop\\nDeparting left us.

When we arriv\\'d\\nNear on the highest ridge of the steep bank,\\nWhere the plain level open\\'d I exclaim\\'d,\\n\"O master! say which way can we proceed?\"\\n\\nHe answer\\'d, \"Let no step of thine recede.\\nBehind me gain the mountain, till to us\\nSome practis\\'d guide appear.\"  That eminence\\nWas lofty that no eye might reach its point,\\nAnd the side proudly rising, more than line\\nFrom the mid quadrant to the centre drawn.\\nI wearied thus began: \"Parent belov\\'d!\\nTurn, and behold how I remain alone,\\nIf thou stay not.\"--\" My son!\"  He straight reply\\'d,\\n\"Thus far put forth thy strength;\" and to a track\\nPointed, that, on this side projecting, round\\nCircles the hill.  His words so spurr\\'d me on,\\nThat I behind him clamb\\'ring, forc\\'d myself,\\nTill my feet press\\'d the circuit plain beneath.\\nThere both together seated, turn\\'d we round\\nTo eastward, whence was our ascent: and oft\\nMany beside have with delight look\\'d back.\\n\\nFirst on the nether shores I turn\\'d my eyes,\\nThen rais\\'d them to the sun, and wond\\'ring mark\\'d\\nThat from the left it smote us.  Soon perceiv\\'d\\nThat Poet sage now at the car of light\\nAmaz\\'d I stood, where \\'twixt us and the north\\nIts course it enter\\'d.  Whence he thus to me:\\n\"Were Leda\\'s offspring now in company\\nOf that broad mirror, that high up and low\\nImparts his light beneath, thou might\\'st behold\\nThe ruddy zodiac nearer to the bears\\nWheel, if its ancient course it not forsook.\\nHow that may be if thou would\\'st think; within\\nPond\\'ring, imagine Sion with this mount\\nPlac\\'d on the earth, so that to both be one\\nHorizon, and two hemispheres apart,\\nWhere lies the path that Phaeton ill knew\\nTo guide his erring chariot: thou wilt see\\nHow of necessity by this on one\\nHe passes, while by that on the\\' other side,\\nIf with clear view shine intellect attend.\"\\n\\n\"Of truth, kind teacher!\"  I exclaim\\'d, \"so clear\\nAught saw I never, as I now discern\\nWhere seem\\'d my ken to fail, that the mid orb\\nOf the supernal motion (which in terms\\nOf art is called the Equator, and remains\\nEver between the sun and winter) for the cause\\nThou hast assign\\'d, from hence toward the north\\nDeparts, when those who in the Hebrew land\\nInhabit, see it tow\\'rds the warmer part.\\nBut if it please thee, I would gladly know,\\nHow far we have to journey: for the hill\\nMounts higher, than this sight of mine can mount.\"\\n\\nHe thus to me: \"Such is this steep ascent,\\nThat it is ever difficult at first,\\nBut, more a man proceeds, less evil grows.\\nWhen pleasant it shall seem to thee, so much\\nThat upward going shall be easy to thee.\\nAs in a vessel to go down the tide,\\nThen of this path thou wilt have reach\\'d the end.\\nThere hope to rest thee from thy toil.

Among them one,\\nWho seem\\'d to me much wearied, sat him down,\\nAnd with his arms did fold his knees about,\\nHolding his face between them downward bent.\\n\\n\"Sweet Sir!\"  I cry\\'d, \"behold that man, who shows\\nHimself more idle, than if laziness\\nWere sister to him.\"  Straight he turn\\'d to us,\\nAnd, o\\'er the thigh lifting his face, observ\\'d,\\nThen in these accents spake: \"Up then, proceed\\nThou valiant one.\"  Straight who it was I knew;\\nNor could the pain I felt (for want of breath\\nStill somewhat urg\\'d me) hinder my approach.\\nAnd when I came to him, he scarce his head\\nUplifted, saying \"Well hast thou discern\\'d,\\nHow from the left the sun his chariot leads.\"\\n\\nHis lazy acts and broken words my lips\\nTo laughter somewhat mov\\'d; when I began:\\n\"Belacqua, now for thee I grieve no more.\\nBut tell, why thou art seated upright there?\\nWaitest thou escort to conduct thee hence?\\nOr blame I only shine accustom\\'d ways?\"\\nThen he: \"My brother, of what use to mount,\\nWhen to my suffering would not let me pass\\nThe bird of God, who at the portal sits?\\nBehooves so long that heav\\'n first bear me round\\nWithout its limits, as in life it bore,\\nBecause I to the end repentant Sighs\\nDelay\\'d, if prayer do not aid me first,\\nThat riseth up from heart which lives in grace.\\nWhat other kind avails, not heard in heaven?\"\\'\\n\\nBefore me now the Poet up the mount\\nAscending, cried: \"Haste thee, for see the sun\\nHas touch\\'d the point meridian, and the night\\nNow covers with her foot Marocco\\'s shore.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO V\\n\\nNow had I left those spirits, and pursued\\nThe steps of my Conductor, when beheld\\nPointing the finger at me one exclaim\\'d:\\n\"See how it seems as if the light not shone\\nFrom the left hand of him beneath, and he,\\nAs living, seems to be led on.\"  Mine eyes\\nI at that sound reverting, saw them gaze\\nThrough wonder first at me, and then at me\\nAnd the light broken underneath, by turns.\\n\"Why are thy thoughts thus riveted?\"  my guide\\nExclaim\\'d, \"that thou hast slack\\'d thy pace? or how\\nImports it thee, what thing is whisper\\'d here?\\nCome after me, and to their babblings leave\\nThe crowd. Be as a tower, that, firmly set,\\nShakes not its top for any blast that blows!\\nHe, in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out,\\nStill of his aim is wide, in that the one\\nSicklies and wastes to nought the other\\'s strength.\"\\n\\nWhat other could I answer save \"I come?\"\\nI said it, somewhat with that colour ting\\'d\\nWhich ofttimes pardon meriteth for man.\\n\\nMeanwhile traverse along the hill there came,\\nA little way before us, some who sang\\nThe \"Miserere\" in responsive Strains.\\nWhen they perceiv\\'d that through my body I\\nGave way not for the rays to pass, their song\\nStraight to a long and hoarse exclaim they chang\\'d;\\nAnd two of them, in guise of messengers,\\nRan on to meet us, and inquiring ask\\'d:\\n\"Of your condition we would gladly learn.\"\\n\\nTo them my guide.  \"Ye may return, and bear\\nTidings to them who sent you, that his frame\\nIs real flesh.

Ah, wherefore go\\'st thou on?\\nAh wherefore tarriest thou not?  We all\\nBy violence died, and to our latest hour\\nWere sinners, but then warn\\'d by light from heav\\'n,\\nSo that, repenting and forgiving, we\\nDid issue out of life at peace with God,\\nWho with desire to see him fills our heart.\"\\n\\nThen I: \"The visages of all I scan\\nYet none of ye remember.  But if aught,\\nThat I can do, may please you, gentle spirits!\\nSpeak; and I will perform it, by that peace,\\nWhich on the steps of guide so excellent\\nFollowing from world to world intent I seek.\"\\n\\nIn answer he began: \"None here distrusts\\nThy kindness, though not promis\\'d with an oath;\\nSo as the will fail not for want of power.\\nWhence I, who sole before the others speak,\\nEntreat thee, if thou ever see that land,\\nWhich lies between Romagna and the realm\\nOf Charles, that of thy courtesy thou pray\\nThose who inhabit Fano, that for me\\nTheir adorations duly be put up,\\nBy which I may purge off my grievous sins.\\nFrom thence I came.

Had I towards Mira fled,\\nWhen overta\\'en at Oriaco, still\\nMight I have breath\\'d. But to the marsh I sped,\\nAnd in the mire and rushes tangled there\\nFell, and beheld my life-blood float the plain.\"\\n\\nThen said another: \"Ah! so may the wish,\\nThat takes thee o\\'er the mountain, be fulfill\\'d,\\nAs thou shalt graciously give aid to mine.\\nOf Montefeltro I; Buonconte I:\\nGiovanna nor none else have care for me,\\nSorrowing with these I therefore go.\"  I thus:\\n\"From Campaldino\\'s field what force or chance\\nDrew thee, that ne\\'er thy sepulture was known?\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\"  answer\\'d he, \"at Casentino\\'s foot\\nA stream there courseth, nam\\'d Archiano, sprung\\nIn Apennine above the Hermit\\'s seat.\\nE\\'en where its name is cancel\\'d, there came I,\\nPierc\\'d in the heart, fleeing away on foot,\\nAnd bloodying the plain.  Here sight and speech\\nFail\\'d me, and finishing with Mary\\'s name\\nI fell, and tenantless my flesh remain\\'d.\\nI will report the truth; which thou again\\nTell to the living.  Me God\\'s angel took,\\nWhilst he of hell exclaim\\'d: \"O thou from heav\\'n!\\nSay wherefore hast thou robb\\'d me?

Thence the valley, soon\\nAs day was spent, he cover\\'d o\\'er with cloud\\nFrom Pratomagno to the mountain range,\\nAnd stretch\\'d the sky above, so that the air\\nImpregnate chang\\'d to water.  Fell the rain,\\nAnd to the fosses came all that the land\\nContain\\'d not; and, as mightiest streams are wont,\\nTo the great river with such headlong sweep\\nRush\\'d, that nought stay\\'d its course.

Count Orso I beheld;\\nAnd from its frame a soul dismiss\\'d for spite\\nAnd envy, as it said, but for no crime:\\nI speak of Peter de la Brosse; and here,\\nWhile she yet lives, that Lady of Brabant\\nLet her beware; lest for so false a deed\\nShe herd with worse than these. When I was freed\\nFrom all those spirits, who pray\\'d for others\\' prayers\\nTo hasten on their state of blessedness;\\nStraight I began: \"O thou, my luminary!\\nIt seems expressly in thy text denied,\\nThat heaven\\'s supreme decree can never bend\\nTo supplication; yet with this design\\nDo these entreat.  Can then their hope be vain,\\nOr is thy saying not to me reveal\\'d?\"\\n\\nHe thus to me: \"Both what I write is plain,\\nAnd these deceiv\\'d not in their hope, if well\\nThy mind consider, that the sacred height\\nOf judgment doth not stoop, because love\\'s flame\\nIn a short moment all fulfils, which he\\nWho sojourns here, in right should satisfy.\\nBesides, when I this point concluded thus,\\nBy praying no defect could be supplied;\\nBecause the pray\\'r had none access to God.\\nYet in this deep suspicion rest thou not\\nContented unless she assure thee so,\\nWho betwixt truth and mind infuses light.\\nI know not if thou take me right; I mean\\nBeatrice.  Her thou shalt behold above,\\nUpon this mountain\\'s crown, fair seat of joy.\"\\n\\nThen I: \"Sir! let us mend our speed; for now\\nI tire not as before; and lo! the hill\\nStretches its shadow far.\"  He answer\\'d thus:\\n\"Our progress with this day shall be as much\\nAs we may now dispatch; but otherwise\\nThan thou supposest is the truth.  For there\\nThou canst not be, ere thou once more behold\\nHim back returning, who behind the steep\\nIs now so hidden, that as erst his beam\\nThou dost not break.  But lo! a spirit there\\nStands solitary, and toward us looks:\\nIt will instruct us in the speediest way.\"\\n\\nWe soon approach\\'d it.  O thou Lombard spirit!\\nHow didst thou stand, in high abstracted mood,\\nScarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes!\\nIt spoke not aught, but let us onward pass,\\nEyeing us as a lion on his watch.\\nBut Virgil with entreaty mild advanc\\'d,\\nRequesting it to show the best ascent.\\nIt answer to his question none return\\'d,\\nBut of our country and our kind of life\\nDemanded.

To Virgil one,\\nThe other to a spirit turn\\'d, who near\\nWas seated, crying: \"Conrad! up with speed:\\nCome, see what of his grace high God hath will\\'d.\"\\nThen turning round to me: \"By that rare mark\\nOf honour which thou ow\\'st to him, who hides\\nSo deeply his first cause, it hath no ford,\\nWhen thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves.\\nTell my Giovanna, that for me she call\\nThere, where reply to innocence is made.\\nHer mother, I believe, loves me no more;\\nSince she has chang\\'d the white and wimpled folds,\\nWhich she is doom\\'d once more with grief to wish.\\nBy her it easily may be perceiv\\'d,\\nHow long in women lasts the flame of love,\\nIf sight and touch do not relume it oft.\\nFor her so fair a burial will not make\\nThe viper which calls Milan to the field,\\nAs had been made by shrill Gallura\\'s bird.\"\\n\\nHe spoke, and in his visage took the stamp\\nOf that right seal, which with due temperature\\nGlows in the bosom.  My insatiate eyes\\nMeanwhile to heav\\'n had travel\\'d, even there\\nWhere the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel\\nNearest the axle; when my guide inquir\\'d:\\n\"What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?\"\\n\\nI answer\\'d: \"The three torches, with which here\\nThe pole is all on fire.\"  He then to me:\\n\"The four resplendent stars, thou saw\\'st this morn\\nAre there beneath, and these ris\\'n in their stead.\"\\n\\nWhile yet he spoke.  Sordello to himself\\nDrew him, and cry\\'d: \"Lo there our enemy!\"\\nAnd with his hand pointed that way to look.\\n\\nAlong the side, where barrier none arose\\nAround the little vale, a serpent lay,\\nSuch haply as gave Eve the bitter food.\\nBetween the grass and flowers, the evil snake\\nCame on, reverting oft his lifted head;\\nAnd, as a beast that smoothes its polish\\'d coat,\\nLicking his hack.

In that hour,\\nWhen near the dawn the swallow her sad lay,\\nRememb\\'ring haply ancient grief, renews,\\nAnd with our minds more wand\\'rers from the flesh,\\nAnd less by thought restrain\\'d are, as \\'t were, full\\nOf holy divination in their dreams,\\nThen in a vision did I seem to view\\nA golden-feather\\'d eagle in the sky,\\nWith open wings, and hov\\'ring for descent,\\nAnd I was in that place, methought, from whence\\nYoung Ganymede, from his associates \\'reft,\\nWas snatch\\'d aloft to the high consistory.\\n\"Perhaps,\" thought I within me, \"here alone\\nHe strikes his quarry, and elsewhere disdains\\nTo pounce upon the prey.\"  Therewith, it seem\\'d,\\nA little wheeling in his airy tour\\nTerrible as the lightning rush\\'d he down,\\nAnd snatch\\'d me upward even to the fire.\\n\\nThere both, I thought, the eagle and myself\\nDid burn; and so intense th\\' imagin\\'d flames,\\nThat needs my sleep was broken off.  As erst\\nAchilles shook himself, and round him roll\\'d\\nHis waken\\'d eyeballs wond\\'ring where he was,\\nWhenas his mother had from Chiron fled\\nTo Scyros, with him sleeping in her arms;\\nE\\'en thus I shook me, soon as from my face\\nThe slumber parted, turning deadly pale,\\nLike one ice-struck with dread.  Solo at my side\\nMy comfort stood: and the bright sun was now\\nMore than two hours aloft: and to the sea\\nMy looks were turn\\'d.  \"Fear not,\" my master cried,\\n\"Assur\\'d we are at happy point.  Thy strength\\nShrink not, but rise dilated.  Thou art come\\nTo Purgatory now.  Lo! there the cliff\\nThat circling bounds it!  Lo! the entrance there,\\nWhere it doth seem disparted! re the dawn\\nUsher\\'d the daylight, when thy wearied soul\\nSlept in thee, o\\'er the flowery vale beneath\\nA lady came, and thus bespake me: \"I\\nAm Lucia.  Suffer me to take this man,\\nWho slumbers.  Easier so his way shall speed.\"\\nSordello and the other gentle shapes\\nTarrying, she bare thee up: and, as day shone,\\nThis summit reach\\'d: and I pursued her steps.\\nHere did she place thee.  First her lovely eyes\\nThat open entrance show\\'d me; then at once\\nShe vanish\\'d with thy sleep.  Like one, whose doubts\\nAre chas\\'d by certainty, and terror turn\\'d\\nTo comfort on discovery of the truth,\\nSuch was the change in me: and as my guide\\nBeheld me fearless, up along the cliff\\nHe mov\\'d, and I behind him, towards the height.\\n\\nReader! thou markest how my theme doth rise,\\nNor wonder therefore, if more artfully\\nI prop the structure! nearer now we drew,\\nArriv\\'d\\' whence in that part, where first a breach\\nAs of a wall appear\\'d, I could descry\\nA portal, and three steps beneath, that led\\nFor inlet there, of different colour each,\\nAnd one who watch\\'d, but spake not yet a word.\\nAs more and more mine eye did stretch its view,\\nI mark\\'d him seated on the highest step,\\nIn visage such, as past my power to bear.\\n\\nGrasp\\'d in his hand a naked sword, glanc\\'d back\\nThe rays so toward me, that I oft in vain\\nMy sight directed.  \"Speak from whence ye stand:\"\\nHe cried: \"What would ye?  Where is your escort?\\nTake heed your coming upward harm ye not.\"\\n\\n\"A heavenly dame, not skilless of these things,\"\\nReplied the\\' instructor, \"told us, even now,\\n\"Pass that way: here the gate is.\" --\"And may she\\nBefriending prosper your ascent,\" resum\\'d\\nThe courteous keeper of the gate: \"Come then\\nBefore our steps.\"  We straightway thither came.\\n\\nThe lowest stair was marble white so smooth\\nAnd polish\\'d, that therein my mirror\\'d form\\nDistinct I saw.  The next of hue more dark\\nThan sablest grain, a rough and singed block,\\nCrack\\'d lengthwise and across.  The third, that lay\\nMassy above, seem\\'d porphyry, that flam\\'d\\nRed as the life-blood spouting from a vein.\\nOn this God\\'s angel either foot sustain\\'d,\\nUpon the threshold seated, which appear\\'d\\nA rock of diamond.  Up the trinal steps\\nMy leader cheerily drew me.  \"Ask,\" said he,\\n\\n\"With humble heart, that he unbar the bolt.\"\\n\\nPiously at his holy feet devolv\\'d\\nI cast me, praying him for pity\\'s sake\\nThat he would open to me: but first fell\\nThrice on my bosom prostrate.  Seven times\\nThe letter, that denotes the inward stain,\\nHe on my forehead with the blunted point\\nOf his drawn sword inscrib\\'d.  And \"Look,\" he cried,\\n\"When enter\\'d, that thou wash these scars away.\"\\n\\nAshes, or earth ta\\'en dry out of the ground,\\nWere of one colour with the robe he wore.\\nFrom underneath that vestment forth he drew\\nTwo keys of metal twain: the one was gold,\\nIts fellow silver.  With the pallid first,\\nAnd next the burnish\\'d, he so ply\\'d the gate,\\nAs to content me well.  \"Whenever one\\nFaileth of these, that in the keyhole straight\\nIt turn not, to this alley then expect\\nAccess in vain.\"  Such were the words he spake.\\n\"One is more precious: but the other needs\\nSkill and sagacity, large share of each,\\nEre its good task to disengage the knot\\nBe worthily perform\\'d.  From Peter these\\nI hold, of him instructed, that I err\\nRather in opening than in keeping fast;\\nSo but the suppliant at my feet implore.\"\\n\\nThen of that hallow\\'d gate he thrust the door,\\nExclaiming, \"Enter, but this warning hear:\\nHe forth again departs who looks behind.\"\\n\\nAs in the hinges of that sacred ward\\nThe swivels turn\\'d, sonorous metal strong,\\nHarsh was the grating; nor so surlily\\nRoar\\'d the Tarpeian, when by force bereft\\nOf good Metellus, thenceforth from his loss\\nTo leanness doom\\'d.  Attentively I turn\\'d,\\nList\\'ning the thunder, that first issued forth;\\nAnd \"We praise thee, O God,\" methought I heard\\nIn accents blended with sweet melody.\\nThe strains came o\\'er mine ear, e\\'en as the sound\\nOf choral voices, that in solemn chant\\nWith organ mingle, and, now high and clear,\\nCome swelling, now float indistinct away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO X\\n\\nWhen we had passed the threshold of the gate\\n(Which the soul\\'s ill affection doth disuse,\\nMaking the crooked seem the straighter path),\\nI heard its closing sound.  Had mine eyes turn\\'d,\\nFor that offence what plea might have avail\\'d?\\n\\nWe mounted up the riven rock, that wound\\nOn either side alternate, as the wave\\nFlies and advances.  \"Here some little art\\nBehooves us,\" said my leader, \"that our steps\\nObserve the varying flexure of the path.\"\\n\\nThus we so slowly sped, that with cleft orb\\nThe moon once more o\\'erhangs her wat\\'ry couch,\\nEre we that strait have threaded.  But when free\\nWe came and open, where the mount above\\nOne solid mass retires, I spent, with toil,\\nAnd both, uncertain of the way, we stood,\\nUpon a plain more lonesome, than the roads\\nThat traverse desert wilds.  From whence the brink\\nBorders upon vacuity, to foot\\nOf the steep bank, that rises still, the space\\nHad measur\\'d thrice the stature of a man:\\nAnd, distant as mine eye could wing its flight,\\nTo leftward now and now to right dispatch\\'d,\\nThat cornice equal in extent appear\\'d.\\n\\nNot yet our feet had on that summit mov\\'d,\\nWhen I discover\\'d that the bank around,\\nWhose proud uprising all ascent denied,\\nWas marble white, and so exactly wrought\\nWith quaintest sculpture, that not there alone\\nHad Polycletus, but e\\'en nature\\'s self\\nBeen sham\\'d.  The angel who came down to earth\\nWith tidings of the peace so many years\\nWept for in vain, that op\\'d the heavenly gates\\nFrom their long interdict, before us seem\\'d,\\nIn a sweet act, so sculptur\\'d to the life,\\nHe look\\'d no silent image. One had sworn\\nHe had said, \"Hail!\" for she was imag\\'d there,\\nBy whom the key did open to God\\'s love,\\nAnd in her act as sensibly impress\\nThat word, \"Behold the handmaid of the Lord,\"\\nAs figure seal\\'d on wax.  \"Fix not thy mind\\nOn one place only,\" said the guide belov\\'d,\\nWho had me near him on that part where lies\\nThe heart of man.  My sight forthwith I turn\\'d\\nAnd mark\\'d, behind the virgin mother\\'s form,\\nUpon that side, where he, that mov\\'d me, stood,\\nAnother story graven on the rock.\\n\\nI passed athwart the bard, and drew me near,\\nThat it might stand more aptly for my view.\\nThere in the self-same marble were engrav\\'d\\nThe cart and kine, drawing the sacred ark,\\nThat from unbidden office awes mankind.\\nBefore it came much people; and the whole\\nParted in seven quires.  One sense cried, \"Nay,\"\\nAnother, \"Yes, they sing.\"  Like doubt arose\\nBetwixt the eye and smell, from the curl\\'d fume\\nOf incense breathing up the well-wrought toil.\\nPreceding the blest vessel, onward came\\nWith light dance leaping, girt in humble guise,\\nSweet Israel\\'s harper: in that hap he seem\\'d\\nLess and yet more than kingly.  Opposite,\\nAt a great palace, from the lattice forth\\nLook\\'d Michol, like a lady full of scorn\\nAnd sorrow.  To behold the tablet next,\\nWhich at the hack of Michol whitely shone,\\nI mov\\'d me.  There was storied on the rock\\nThe\\' exalted glory of the Roman prince,\\nWhose mighty worth mov\\'d Gregory to earn\\nHis mighty conquest, Trajan th\\' Emperor.\\nA widow at his bridle stood, attir\\'d\\nIn tears and mourning.  Round about them troop\\'d\\nFull throng of knights, and overhead in gold\\nThe eagles floated, struggling with the wind.\\n\\nThe wretch appear\\'d amid all these to say:\\n\"Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart\\nMy son is murder\\'d.\"  He replying seem\\'d;\\n\\n\"Wait now till I return.\" And she, as one\\nMade hasty by her grief; \"O sire, if thou\\nDost not return?\"--\"Where I am, who then is,\\nMay right thee.\"--\"What to thee is other\\'s good,\\nIf thou neglect thy own?\"--\"Now comfort thee,\"\\nAt length he answers.  \"It beseemeth well\\nMy duty be perform\\'d, ere I move hence:\\nSo justice wills; and pity bids me stay.\"\\n\\nHe, whose ken nothing new surveys, produc\\'d\\nThat visible speaking, new to us and strange\\nThe like not found on earth.  Fondly I gaz\\'d\\nUpon those patterns of meek humbleness,\\nShapes yet more precious for their artist\\'s sake,\\nWhen \"Lo,\" the poet whisper\\'d, \"where this way\\n(But slack their pace), a multitude advance.\\nThese to the lofty steps shall guide us on.\"\\n\\nMine eyes, though bent on view of novel sights\\nTheir lov\\'d allurement, were not slow to turn.\\n\\nReader! would not that amaz\\'d thou miss\\nOf thy good purpose, hearing how just God\\nDecrees our debts be cancel\\'d.

Think on what succeeds,\\nThink that at worst beyond the mighty doom\\nIt cannot pass.  \"Instructor,\" I began,\\n\"What I see hither tending, bears no trace\\nOf human semblance, nor of aught beside\\nThat my foil\\'d sight can guess.\"  He answering thus:\\n\"So courb\\'d to earth, beneath their heavy teems\\nOf torment stoop they, that mine eye at first\\nStruggled as thine.

Dead the dead,\\nThe living seem\\'d alive; with clearer view\\nHis eye beheld not who beheld the truth,\\nThan mine what I did tread on, while I went\\nLow bending.  Now swell out; and with stiff necks\\nPass on, ye sons of Eve! veil not your looks,\\nLest they descry the evil of your path!\\n\\nI noted not (so busied was my thought)\\nHow much we now had circled of the mount,\\nAnd of his course yet more the sun had spent,\\nWhen he, who with still wakeful caution went,\\nAdmonish\\'d: \"Raise thou up thy head: for know\\nTime is not now for slow suspense.

He led us on\\nWhere the rock parted; here against my front\\nDid beat his wings, then promis\\'d I should fare\\nIn safety on my way.  As to ascend\\nThat steep, upon whose brow the chapel stands\\n(O\\'er Rubaconte, looking lordly down\\nOn the well-guided city,) up the right\\nTh\\' impetuous rise is broken by the steps\\nCarv\\'d in that old and simple age, when still\\nThe registry and label rested safe;\\nThus is th\\' acclivity reliev\\'d, which here\\nPrecipitous from the other circuit falls:\\nBut on each hand the tall cliff presses close.\\n\\nAs ent\\'ring there we turn\\'d, voices, in strain\\nIneffable, sang: \"Blessed are the poor\\nIn spirit.\"  Ah how far unlike to these\\nThe straits of hell; here songs to usher us,\\nThere shrieks of woe!  We climb the holy stairs:\\nAnd lighter to myself by far I seem\\'d\\nThan on the plain before, whence thus I spake:\\n\"Say, master, of what heavy thing have I\\nBeen lighten\\'d, that scarce aught the sense of toil\\nAffects me journeying?\"  He in few replied:\\n\"When sin\\'s broad characters, that yet remain\\nUpon thy temples, though well nigh effac\\'d,\\nShall be, as one is, all clean razed out,\\nThen shall thy feet by heartiness of will\\nBe so o\\'ercome, they not alone shall feel\\nNo sense of labour, but delight much more\\nShall wait them urg\\'d along their upward way.\"\\n\\nThen like to one, upon whose head is plac\\'d\\nSomewhat he deems not of but from the becks\\nOf others as they pass him by; his hand\\nLends therefore help to\\' assure him, searches, finds,\\nAnd well performs such office as the eye\\nWants power to execute: so stretching forth\\nThe fingers of my right hand, did I find\\nSix only of the letters, which his sword\\nWho bare the keys had trac\\'d upon my brow.\\nThe leader, as he mark\\'d mine action, smil\\'d.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XIII\\n\\nWe reach\\'d the summit of the scale, and stood\\nUpon the second buttress of that mount\\nWhich healeth him who climbs.  A cornice there,\\nLike to the former, girdles round the hill;\\nSave that its arch with sweep less ample bends.\\n\\nShadow nor image there is seen; all smooth\\nThe rampart and the path, reflecting nought\\nBut the rock\\'s sullen hue.  \"If here we wait\\nFor some to question,\" said the bard, \"I fear\\nOur choice may haply meet too long delay.\"\\n\\nThen fixedly upon the sun his eyes\\nHe fastn\\'d, made his right the central point\\nFrom whence to move, and turn\\'d the left aside.\\n\"O pleasant light, my confidence and hope,\\nConduct us thou,\" he cried, \"on this new way,\\nWhere now I venture, leading to the bourn\\nWe seek.  The universal world to thee\\nOwes warmth and lustre.  If no other cause\\nForbid, thy beams should ever be our guide.\"\\n\\nFar, as is measur\\'d for a mile on earth,\\nIn brief space had we journey\\'d; such prompt will\\nImpell\\'d; and towards us flying, now were heard\\nSpirits invisible, who courteously\\nUnto love\\'s table bade the welcome guest.\\nThe voice, that firstlew by, call\\'d forth aloud,\\n\"They have no wine;\" so on behind us past,\\nThose sounds reiterating, nor yet lost\\nIn the faint distance, when another came\\nCrying, \"I am Orestes,\" and alike\\nWing\\'d its fleet way.  \"Oh father!\"  I exclaim\\'d,\\n\"What tongues are these?\"  and as I question\\'d, lo!\\nA third exclaiming, \"Love ye those have wrong\\'d you.\"\\n\\n\"This circuit,\" said my teacher, \"knots the scourge\\nFor envy, and the cords are therefore drawn\\nBy charity\\'s correcting hand.  The curb\\nIs of a harsher sound, as thou shalt hear\\n(If I deem rightly), ere thou reach the pass,\\nWhere pardon sets them free.  But fix thine eyes\\nIntently through the air, and thou shalt see\\nA multitude before thee seated, each\\nAlong the shelving grot.\"  Then more than erst\\nI op\\'d my eyes, before me view\\'d, and saw\\nShadows with garments dark as was the rock;\\nAnd when we pass\\'d a little forth, I heard\\nA crying, \"Blessed Mary! pray for us,\\nMichael and Peter! all ye saintly host!\"\\n\\nI do not think there walks on earth this day\\nMan so remorseless, that he hath not yearn\\'d\\nWith pity at the sight that next I saw.\\nMine eyes a load of sorrow teemed, when now\\nI stood so near them, that their semblances\\nCame clearly to my view.  Of sackcloth vile\\nTheir cov\\'ring seem\\'d; and on his shoulder one\\nDid stay another, leaning, and all lean\\'d\\nAgainst the cliff.  E\\'en thus the blind and poor,\\nNear the confessionals, to crave an alms,\\nStand, each his head upon his fellow\\'s sunk,\\n\\nSo most to stir compassion, not by sound\\nOf words alone, but that, which moves not less,\\nThe sight of mis\\'ry.  And as never beam\\nOf noonday visiteth the eyeless man,\\nE\\'en so was heav\\'n a niggard unto these\\nOf his fair light; for, through the orbs of all,\\nA thread of wire, impiercing, knits them up,\\nAs for the taming of a haggard hawk.\\n\\nIt were a wrong, methought, to pass and look\\nOn others, yet myself the while unseen.\\nTo my sage counsel therefore did I turn.\\nHe knew the meaning of the mute appeal,\\nNor waited for my questioning, but said:\\n\"Speak; and be brief, be subtle in thy words.\"\\n\\nOn that part of the cornice, whence no rim\\nEngarlands its steep fall, did Virgil come;\\nOn the\\' other side me were the spirits, their cheeks\\nBathing devout with penitential tears,\\nThat through the dread impalement forc\\'d a way.\\n\\nI turn\\'d me to them, and \"O shades!\" said I,\\n\\n\"Assur\\'d that to your eyes unveil\\'d shall shine\\nThe lofty light, sole object of your wish,\\nSo may heaven\\'s grace clear whatsoe\\'er of foam\\nFloats turbid on the conscience, that thenceforth\\nThe stream of mind roll limpid from its source,\\nAs ye declare (for so shall ye impart\\nA boon I dearly prize) if any soul\\nOf Latium dwell among ye; and perchance\\nThat soul may profit, if I learn so much.\"\\n\\n\"My brother, we are each one citizens\\nOf one true city.  Any thou wouldst say,\\nWho lived a stranger in Italia\\'s land.\"\\n\\nSo heard I answering, as appeal\\'d, a voice\\nThat onward came some space from whence I stood.\\n\\nA spirit I noted, in whose look was mark\\'d\\nExpectance.  Ask ye how?  The chin was rais\\'d\\nAs in one reft of sight.  \"Spirit,\" said I,\\n\"Who for thy rise are tutoring (if thou be\\nThat which didst answer to me,) or by place\\nOr name, disclose thyself, that I may know thee.\"\\n\\n\"I was,\" it answer\\'d, \"of Sienna: here\\nI cleanse away with these the evil life,\\nSoliciting with tears that He, who is,\\nVouchsafe him to us.

But the woe beneath\\nUrges my soul with more exceeding dread.\\nThat nether load already weighs me down.\"\\n\\nShe thus: \"Who then amongst us here aloft\\nHath brought thee, if thou weenest to return?\"\\n\\n\"He,\" answer\\'d I, \"who standeth mute beside me.\\nI live: of me ask therefore, chosen spirit,\\nIf thou desire I yonder yet should move\\nFor thee my mortal feet.\"--\"Oh!\" she replied,\\n\"This is so strange a thing, it is great sign\\nThat God doth love thee.  Therefore with thy prayer\\nSometime assist me: and by that I crave,\\nWhich most thou covetest, that if thy feet\\nE\\'er tread on Tuscan soil, thou save my fame\\nAmongst my kindred.  Them shalt thou behold\\nWith that vain multitude, who set their hope\\nOn Telamone\\'s haven, there to fail\\nConfounded, more shall when the fancied stream\\nThey sought of Dian call\\'d: but they who lead\\nTheir navies, more than ruin\\'d hopes shall mourn.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XIV\\n\\n\"Say who is he around our mountain winds,\\nOr ever death has prun\\'d his wing for flight,\\nThat opes his eyes and covers them at will?\"\\n\\n\"I know not who he is, but know thus much\\nHe comes not singly.  Do thou ask of him,\\nFor thou art nearer to him, and take heed\\nAccost him gently, so that he may speak.\"\\n\\nThus on the right two Spirits bending each\\nToward the other, talk\\'d of me, then both\\nAddressing me, their faces backward lean\\'d,\\nAnd thus the one began: \"O soul, who yet\\nPent in the body, tendest towards the sky!\\nFor charity, we pray thee\\' comfort us,\\nRecounting whence thou com\\'st, and who thou art:\\nFor thou dost make us at the favour shown thee\\nMarvel, as at a thing that ne\\'er hath been.\"\\n\\n\"There stretches through the midst of Tuscany,\"\\nI straight began: \"a brooklet, whose well-head\\nSprings up in Falterona, with his race\\nNot satisfied, when he some hundred miles\\nHath measur\\'d.  From his banks bring, I this frame.\\nTo tell you who I am were words misspent:\\nFor yet my name scarce sounds on rumour\\'s lip.\"\\n\\n\"If well I do incorp\\'rate with my thought\\nThe meaning of thy speech,\" said he, who first\\nAddrest me, \"thou dost speak of Arno\\'s wave.\"\\n\\nTo whom the other: \"Why hath he conceal\\'d\\nThe title of that river, as a man\\nDoth of some horrible thing?\"  The spirit, who\\nThereof was question\\'d, did acquit him thus:\\n\"I know not: but \\'tis fitting well the name\\nShould perish of that vale; for from the source\\nWhere teems so plenteously the Alpine steep\\nMaim\\'d of Pelorus, (that doth scarcely pass\\nBeyond that limit,) even to the point\\nWhereunto ocean is restor\\'d, what heaven\\nDrains from th\\' exhaustless store for all earth\\'s streams,\\nThroughout the space is virtue worried down,\\nAs \\'twere a snake, by all, for mortal foe,\\nOr through disastrous influence on the place,\\nOr else distortion of misguided wills,\\nThat custom goads to evil: whence in those,\\nThe dwellers in that miserable vale,\\nNature is so transform\\'d, it seems as they\\nHad shar\\'d of Circe\\'s feeding.  \\'Midst brute swine,\\nWorthier of acorns than of other food\\nCreated for man\\'s use, he shapeth first\\nHis obscure way; then, sloping onward, finds\\nCurs, snarlers more in spite than power, from whom\\nHe turns with scorn aside: still journeying down,\\nBy how much more the curst and luckless foss\\nSwells out to largeness, e\\'en so much it finds\\nDogs turning into wolves.  Descending still\\nThrough yet more hollow eddies, next he meets\\nA race of foxes, so replete with craft,\\nThey do not fear that skill can master it.\\nNor will I cease because my words are heard\\nBy other ears than thine.  It shall be well\\nFor this man, if he keep in memory\\nWhat from no erring Spirit I reveal.\\nLo! behold thy grandson, that becomes\\nA hunter of those wolves, upon the shore\\nOf the fierce stream, and cows them all with dread:\\nTheir flesh yet living sets he up to sale,\\nThen like an aged beast to slaughter dooms.\\nMany of life he reaves, himself of worth\\nAnd goodly estimation.

Their silence therefore of our way\\nAssur\\'d us.  Soon as we had quitted them,\\nAdvancing onward, lo! a voice that seem\\'d\\nLike vollied light\\'ning, when it rives the air,\\nMet us, and shouted, \"Whosoever finds\\nWill slay me,\" then fled from us, as the bolt\\nLanc\\'d sudden from a downward-rushing cloud.\\nWhen it had giv\\'n short truce unto our hearing,\\nBehold the other with a crash as loud\\nAs the quick-following thunder: \"Mark in me\\nAglauros turn\\'d to rock.\"  I at the sound\\nRetreating drew more closely to my guide.\\n\\nNow in mute stillness rested all the air:\\nAnd thus he spake: \"There was the galling bit.\\nBut your old enemy so baits his hook,\\nHe drags you eager to him.

The cause unknown, amaze\\nPossess\\'d me, and both hands against my brow\\nLifting, I interpos\\'d them, as a screen,\\nThat of its gorgeous superflux of light\\nClipp\\'d the diminish\\'d orb. As when the ray,\\nStriking On water or the surface clear\\nOf mirror, leaps unto the opposite part,\\nAscending at a glance, e\\'en as it fell,\\n(And so much differs from the stone, that falls\\nThrough equal space, as practice skill hath shown);\\nThus with refracted light before me seemed\\nThe ground there smitten; whence in sudden haste\\nMy sight recoil\\'d.  \"What is this, sire belov\\'d!\\n\\'Gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain?\"\\nCried I, \"and which towards us moving seems?\"\\n\\n\"Marvel not, if the family of heav\\'n,\"\\nHe answer\\'d, \"yet with dazzling radiance dim\\nThy sense it is a messenger who comes,\\nInviting man\\'s ascent.

Behold thy sire and I\\nSorrowing have sought thee;\" and so held her peace,\\nAnd straight the vision fled.  A female next\\nAppear\\'d before me, down whose visage cours\\'d\\nThose waters, that grief forces out from one\\nBy deep resentment stung, who seem\\'d to say:\\n\"If thou, Pisistratus, be lord indeed\\nOver this city, nam\\'d with such debate\\nOf adverse gods, and whence each science sparkles,\\nAvenge thee of those arms, whose bold embrace\\nHath clasp\\'d our daughter; \"and to fuel, meseem\\'d,\\nBenign and meek, with visage undisturb\\'d,\\nHer sovran spake: \"How shall we those requite,\\nWho wish us evil, if we thus condemn\\nThe man that loves us?\"  After that I saw\\nA multitude, in fury burning, slay\\nWith stones a stripling youth, and shout amain\\n\"Destroy, destroy:\" and him I saw, who bow\\'d\\nHeavy with death unto the ground, yet made\\nHis eyes, unfolded upward, gates to heav\\'n,\\n\\nPraying forgiveness of th\\' Almighty Sire,\\nAmidst that cruel conflict, on his foes,\\nWith looks, that With compassion to their aim.\\n\\nSoon as my spirit, from her airy flight\\nReturning, sought again the things, whose truth\\nDepends not on her shaping, I observ\\'d\\nHow she had rov\\'d to no unreal scenes\\n\\nMeanwhile the leader, who might see I mov\\'d,\\nAs one, who struggles to shake off his sleep,\\nExclaim\\'d: \"What ails thee, that thou canst not hold\\nThy footing firm, but more than half a league\\nHast travel\\'d with clos\\'d eyes and tott\\'ring gait,\\nLike to a man by wine or sleep o\\'ercharg\\'d?\"\\n\\n\"Beloved father! so thou deign,\" said I,\\n\"To listen, I will tell thee what appear\\'d\\nBefore me, when so fail\\'d my sinking steps.\"\\n\\nHe thus: \"Not if thy Countenance were mask\\'d\\nWith hundred vizards, could a thought of thine\\nHow small soe\\'er, elude me.

Such goads\\nThe slow and loit\\'ring need; that they be found\\nNot wanting, when their hour of watch returns.\"\\n\\nSo on we journey\\'d through the evening sky\\nGazing intent, far onward, as our eyes\\nWith level view could stretch against the bright\\nVespertine ray: and lo! by slow degrees\\nGath\\'ring, a fog made tow\\'rds us, dark as night.\\nThere was no room for \\'scaping; and that mist\\nBereft us, both of sight and the pure air.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XVI\\n\\nHell\\'s dunnest gloom, or night unlustrous, dark,\\nOf every planes \\'reft, and pall\\'d in clouds,\\nDid never spread before the sight a veil\\nIn thickness like that fog, nor to the sense\\nSo palpable and gross.  Ent\\'ring its shade,\\nMine eye endured not with unclosed lids;\\nWhich marking, near me drew the faithful guide,\\nOffering me his shoulder for a stay.\\n\\nAs the blind man behind his leader walks,\\nLest he should err, or stumble unawares\\nOn what might harm him, or perhaps destroy,\\nI journey\\'d through that bitter air and foul,\\nStill list\\'ning to my escort\\'s warning voice,\\n\"Look that from me thou part not.\"  Straight I heard\\nVoices, and each one seem\\'d to pray for peace,\\nAnd for compassion, to the Lamb of God\\nThat taketh sins away.  Their prelude still\\nWas \"Agnus Dei,\" and through all the choir,\\nOne voice, one measure ran, that perfect seem\\'d\\nThe concord of their song.  \"Are these I hear\\nSpirits, O master?\"  I exclaim\\'d; and he:\\n\"Thou aim\\'st aright: these loose the bonds of wrath.\"\\n\\n\"Now who art thou, that through our smoke dost cleave?\\nAnd speak\\'st of us, as thou thyself e\\'en yet\\nDividest time by calends?\"  So one voice\\nBespake me; whence my master said: \"Reply;\\nAnd ask, if upward hence the passage lead.\"\\n\\n\"O being! who dost make thee pure, to stand\\nBeautiful once more in thy Maker\\'s sight!\\nAlong with me: and thou shalt hear and wonder.\"\\nThus I, whereto the spirit answering spake:\\n\\n\"Long as \\'t is lawful for me, shall my steps\\nFollow on thine; and since the cloudy smoke\\nForbids the seeing, hearing in its stead\\nShall keep us join\\'d.\"  I then forthwith began\\n\"Yet in my mortal swathing, I ascend\\nTo higher regions, and am hither come\\nThrough the fearful agony of hell.\\nAnd, if so largely God hath doled his grace,\\nThat, clean beside all modern precedent,\\nHe wills me to behold his kingly state,\\nFrom me conceal not who thou wast, ere death\\nHad loos\\'d thee; but instruct me: and instruct\\nIf rightly to the pass I tend; thy words\\nThe way directing as a safe escort.\"\\n\\n\"I was of Lombardy, and Marco call\\'d:\\nNot inexperienc\\'d of the world, that worth\\nI still affected, from which all have turn\\'d\\nThe nerveless bow aside.  Thy course tends right\\nUnto the summit:\" and, replying thus,\\nHe added, \"I beseech thee pray for me,\\nWhen thou shalt come aloft.\"  And I to him:\\n\"Accept my faith for pledge I will perform\\nWhat thou requirest.  Yet one doubt remains,\\nThat wrings me sorely, if I solve it not,\\nSingly before it urg\\'d me, doubled now\\nBy thine opinion, when I couple that\\nWith one elsewhere declar\\'d, each strength\\'ning other.\\nThe world indeed is even so forlorn\\nOf all good as thou speak\\'st it and so swarms\\nWith every evil.  Yet, beseech thee, point\\nThe cause out to me, that myself may see,\\nAnd unto others show it: for in heaven\\nOne places it, and one on earth below.\"\\n\\nThen heaving forth a deep and audible sigh,\\n\"Brother!\" he thus began, \"the world is blind;\\nAnd thou in truth com\\'st from it.  Ye, who live,\\nDo so each cause refer to heav\\'n above,\\nE\\'en as its motion of necessity\\nDrew with it all that moves.  If this were so,\\nFree choice in you were none; nor justice would\\nThere should be joy for virtue, woe for ill.\\nYour movements have their primal bent from heaven;\\nNot all; yet said I all; what then ensues?\\nLight have ye still to follow evil or good,\\nAnd of the will free power, which, if it stand\\nFirm and unwearied in Heav\\'n\\'s first assay,\\nConquers at last, so it be cherish\\'d well,\\nTriumphant over all.  To mightier force,\\nTo better nature subject, ye abide\\nFree, not constrain\\'d by that, which forms in you\\nThe reasoning mind uninfluenc\\'d of the stars.\\nIf then the present race of mankind err,\\nSeek in yourselves the cause, and find it there.\\nHerein thou shalt confess me no false spy.\\n\\n\"Forth from his plastic hand, who charm\\'d beholds\\nHer image ere she yet exist, the soul\\nComes like a babe, that wantons sportively\\nWeeping and laughing in its wayward moods,\\nAs artless and as ignorant of aught,\\nSave that her Maker being one who dwells\\nWith gladness ever, willingly she turns\\nTo whate\\'er yields her joy.  Of some slight good\\nThe flavour soon she tastes; and, snar\\'d by that,\\nWith fondness she pursues it, if no guide\\nRecall, no rein direct her wand\\'ring course.\\nHence it behov\\'d, the law should be a curb;\\nA sovereign hence behov\\'d, whose piercing view\\nMight mark at least the fortress and main tower\\nOf the true city.  Laws indeed there are:\\nBut who is he observes them?  None; not he,\\nWho goes before, the shepherd of the flock,\\nWho chews the cud but doth not cleave the hoof.\\nTherefore the multitude, who see their guide\\nStrike at the very good they covet most,\\nFeed there and look no further.  Thus the cause\\nIs not corrupted nature in yourselves,\\nBut ill-conducting, that hath turn\\'d the world\\nTo evil.  Rome, that turn\\'d it unto good,\\nWas wont to boast two suns, whose several beams\\nCast light on either way, the world\\'s and God\\'s.\\nOne since hath quench\\'d the other; and the sword\\nIs grafted on the crook; and so conjoin\\'d\\nEach must perforce decline to worse, unaw\\'d\\nBy fear of other.  If thou doubt me, mark\\nThe blade: each herb is judg\\'d of by its seed.\\nThat land, through which Adice and the Po\\nTheir waters roll, was once the residence\\nOf courtesy and velour, ere the day,\\nThat frown\\'d on Frederick; now secure may pass\\nThose limits, whosoe\\'er hath left, for shame,\\nTo talk with good men, or come near their haunts.\\nThree aged ones are still found there, in whom\\nThe old time chides the new: these deem it long\\nEre God restore them to a better world:\\nThe good Gherardo, of Palazzo he\\nConrad, and Guido of Castello, nam\\'d\\nIn Gallic phrase more fitly the plain Lombard.\\nOn this at last conclude.

God be with you.\\nI bear you company no more.  Behold\\nThe dawn with white ray glimm\\'ring through the mist.\\nI must away--the angel comes--ere he\\nAppear.\"  He said, and would not hear me more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XVII\\n\\nCall to remembrance, reader, if thou e\\'er\\nHast, on a mountain top, been ta\\'en by cloud,\\nThrough which thou saw\\'st no better, than the mole\\nDoth through opacous membrane; then, whene\\'er\\nThe wat\\'ry vapours dense began to melt\\nInto thin air, how faintly the sun\\'s sphere\\nSeem\\'d wading through them; so thy nimble thought\\nMay image, how at first I re-beheld\\nThe sun, that bedward now his couch o\\'erhung.\\n\\nThus with my leader\\'s feet still equaling pace\\nFrom forth that cloud I came, when now expir\\'d\\nThe parting beams from off the nether shores.\\n\\nO quick and forgetive power! that sometimes dost\\nSo rob us of ourselves, we take no mark\\nThough round about us thousand trumpets clang!\\nWhat moves thee, if the senses stir not?  Light\\nKindled in heav\\'n, spontaneous, self-inform\\'d,\\nOr likelier gliding down with swift illapse\\nBy will divine.  Portray\\'d before me came\\nThe traces of her dire impiety,\\nWhose form was chang\\'d into the bird, that most\\nDelights itself in song: and here my mind\\nWas inwardly so wrapt, it gave no place\\nTo aught that ask\\'d admittance from without.\\n\\nNext shower\\'d into my fantasy a shape\\nAs of one crucified, whose visage spake\\nFell rancour, malice deep, wherein he died;\\nAnd round him Ahasuerus the great king,\\nEsther his bride, and Mordecai the just,\\nBlameless in word and deed.  As of itself\\nThat unsubstantial coinage of the brain\\nBurst, like a bubble, Which the water fails\\nThat fed it; in my vision straight uprose\\nA damsel weeping loud, and cried, \"O queen!\\nO mother! wherefore has intemperate ire\\nDriv\\'n thee to loath thy being?  Not to lose\\nLavinia, desp\\'rate thou hast slain thyself.\\nNow hast thou lost me.  I am she, whose tears\\nMourn, ere I fall, a mother\\'s timeless end.\"\\n\\nE\\'en as a sleep breaks off, if suddenly\\nNew radiance strike upon the closed lids,\\nThe broken slumber quivering ere it dies;\\nThus from before me sunk that imagery\\nVanishing, soon as on my face there struck\\nThe light, outshining far our earthly beam.\\nAs round I turn\\'d me to survey what place\\nI had arriv\\'d at, \"Here ye mount,\" exclaim\\'d\\nA voice, that other purpose left me none,\\nSave will so eager to behold who spake,\\nI could not choose but gaze.  As \\'fore the sun,\\nThat weighs our vision down, and veils his form\\nIn light transcendent, thus my virtue fail\\'d\\nUnequal.  \"This is Spirit from above,\\nWho marshals us our upward way, unsought;\\nAnd in his own light shrouds him.  As a man\\nDoth for himself, so now is done for us.\\nFor whoso waits imploring, yet sees need\\nOf his prompt aidance, sets himself prepar\\'d\\nFor blunt denial, ere the suit be made.\\nRefuse we not to lend a ready foot\\nAt such inviting: haste we to ascend,\\nBefore it darken: for we may not then,\\nTill morn again return.\"  So spake my guide;\\nAnd to one ladder both address\\'d our steps;\\nAnd the first stair approaching, I perceiv\\'d\\nNear me as \\'twere the waving of a wing,\\nThat fann\\'d my face and whisper\\'d: \"Blessed they\\nThe peacemakers: they know not evil wrath.\"\\n\\nNow to such height above our heads were rais\\'d\\nThe last beams, follow\\'d close by hooded night,\\nThat many a star on all sides through the gloom\\nShone out.  \"Why partest from me, O my strength?\"\\nSo with myself I commun\\'d; for I felt\\nMy o\\'ertoil\\'d sinews slacken.  We had reach\\'d\\nThe summit, and were fix\\'d like to a bark\\nArriv\\'d at land.  And waiting a short space,\\nIf aught should meet mine ear in that new round,\\nThen to my guide I turn\\'d, and said: \"Lov\\'d sire!\\nDeclare what guilt is on this circle purg\\'d.\\nIf our feet rest, no need thy speech should pause.\"\\n\\nHe thus to me: \"The love of good, whate\\'er\\nWanted of just proportion, here fulfils.\\nHere plies afresh the oar, that loiter\\'d ill.\\nBut that thou mayst yet clearlier understand,\\nGive ear unto my words, and thou shalt cull\\nSome fruit may please thee well, from this delay.\\n\\n\"Creator, nor created being, ne\\'er,\\nMy son,\" he thus began, \"was without love,\\nOr natural, or the free spirit\\'s growth.\\nThou hast not that to learn.  The natural still\\nIs without error; but the other swerves,\\nIf on ill object bent, or through excess\\nOf vigour, or defect.  While e\\'er it seeks\\nThe primal blessings, or with measure due\\nTh\\' inferior, no delight, that flows from it,\\nPartakes of ill.  But let it warp to evil,\\nOr with more ardour than behooves, or less.\\nPursue the good, the thing created then\\nWorks \\'gainst its Maker.  Hence thou must infer\\nThat love is germin of each virtue in ye,\\nAnd of each act no less, that merits pain.\\nNow since it may not be, but love intend\\nThe welfare mainly of the thing it loves,\\nAll from self-hatred are secure; and since\\nNo being can be thought t\\' exist apart\\nAnd independent of the first, a bar\\nOf equal force restrains from hating that.\\n\\n\"Grant the distinction just; and it remains\\nThe\\' evil must be another\\'s, which is lov\\'d.\\nThree ways such love is gender\\'d in your clay.\\nThere is who hopes (his neighbour\\'s worth deprest,)\\nPreeminence himself, and coverts hence\\nFor his own greatness that another fall.\\nThere is who so much fears the loss of power,\\nFame, favour, glory (should his fellow mount\\nAbove him), and so sickens at the thought,\\nHe loves their opposite: and there is he,\\nWhom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame\\nThat he doth thirst for vengeance, and such needs\\nMust doat on other\\'s evil.  Here beneath\\nThis threefold love is mourn\\'d.  Of th\\' other sort\\nBe now instructed, that which follows good\\nBut with disorder\\'d and irregular course.\\n\\n\"All indistinctly apprehend a bliss\\nOn which the soul may rest, the hearts of all\\nYearn after it, and to that wished bourn\\nAll therefore strive to tend.  If ye behold\\nOr seek it with a love remiss and lax,\\nThis cornice after just repenting lays\\nIts penal torment on ye.  Other good\\nThere is, where man finds not his happiness:\\nIt is not true fruition, not that blest\\nEssence, of every good the branch and root.\\nThe love too lavishly bestow\\'d on this,\\nAlong three circles over us, is mourn\\'d.\\nAccount of that division tripartite\\nExpect not, fitter for thine own research.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XVIII\\n\\nThe teacher ended, and his high discourse\\nConcluding, earnest in my looks inquir\\'d\\nIf I appear\\'d content; and I, whom still\\nUnsated thirst to hear him urg\\'d, was mute,\\nMute outwardly, yet inwardly I said:\\n\"Perchance my too much questioning offends\"\\nBut he, true father, mark\\'d the secret wish\\nBy diffidence restrain\\'d, and speaking, gave\\nMe boldness thus to speak: \\'Master, my Sight\\nGathers so lively virtue from thy beams,\\nThat all, thy words convey, distinct is seen.\\nWherefore I pray thee, father, whom this heart\\nHolds dearest! thou wouldst deign by proof t\\' unfold\\nThat love, from which as from their source thou bring\\'st\\nAll good deeds and their opposite.\\'\"  He then:\\n\"To what I now disclose be thy clear ken\\nDirected, and thou plainly shalt behold\\nHow much those blind have err\\'d, who make themselves\\nThe guides of men.  The soul, created apt\\nTo love, moves versatile which way soe\\'er\\nAught pleasing prompts her, soon as she is wak\\'d\\nBy pleasure into act.  Of substance true\\nYour apprehension forms its counterfeit,\\nAnd in you the ideal shape presenting\\nAttracts the soul\\'s regard.  If she, thus drawn,\\nincline toward it, love is that inclining,\\nAnd a new nature knit by pleasure in ye.\\nThen as the fire points up, and mounting seeks\\nHis birth-place and his lasting seat, e\\'en thus\\nEnters the captive soul into desire,\\nWhich is a spiritual motion, that ne\\'er rests\\nBefore enjoyment of the thing it loves.\\nEnough to show thee, how the truth from those\\nIs hidden, who aver all love a thing\\nPraise-worthy in itself: although perhaps\\nIts substance seem still good.  Yet if the wax\\nBe good, it follows not th\\' impression must.\"\\n\"What love is,\" I return\\'d, \"thy words, O guide!\\nAnd my own docile mind, reveal.  Yet thence\\nNew doubts have sprung.  For from without if love\\nBe offer\\'d to us, and the spirit knows\\nNo other footing, tend she right or wrong,\\nIs no desert of hers.\"  He answering thus:\\n\"What reason here discovers I have power\\nTo show thee: that which lies beyond, expect\\nFrom Beatrice, faith not reason\\'s task.\\nSpirit, substantial form, with matter join\\'d\\nNot in confusion mix\\'d, hath in itself\\nSpecific virtue of that union born,\\nWhich is not felt except it work, nor prov\\'d\\nBut through effect, as vegetable life\\nBy the green leaf.  From whence his intellect\\nDeduced its primal notices of things,\\nMan therefore knows not, or his appetites\\nTheir first affections; such in you, as zeal\\nIn bees to gather honey; at the first,\\nVolition, meriting nor blame nor praise.\\nBut o\\'er each lower faculty supreme,\\nThat as she list are summon\\'d to her bar,\\nYe have that virtue in you, whose just voice\\nUttereth counsel, and whose word should keep\\nThe threshold of assent.  Here is the source,\\nWhence cause of merit in you is deriv\\'d,\\nE\\'en as the affections good or ill she takes,\\nOr severs, winnow\\'d as the chaff.  Those men\\nWho reas\\'ning went to depth profoundest, mark\\'d\\nThat innate freedom, and were thence induc\\'d\\nTo leave their moral teaching to the world.\\nGrant then, that from necessity arise\\nAll love that glows within you; to dismiss\\nOr harbour it, the pow\\'r is in yourselves.\\nRemember, Beatrice, in her style,\\nDenominates free choice by eminence\\nThe noble virtue, if in talk with thee\\nShe touch upon that theme.\"  The moon, well nigh\\nTo midnight hour belated, made the stars\\nAppear to wink and fade; and her broad disk\\nSeem\\'d like a crag on fire, as up the vault\\nThat course she journey\\'d, which the sun then warms,\\nWhen they of Rome behold him at his set.\\nBetwixt Sardinia and the Corsic isle.\\nAnd now the weight, that hung upon my thought,\\nWas lighten\\'d by the aid of that clear spirit,\\nWho raiseth Andes above Mantua\\'s name.\\nI therefore, when my questions had obtain\\'d\\nSolution plain and ample, stood as one\\nMusing in dreary slumber; but not long\\nSlumber\\'d; for suddenly a multitude,\\n\\nThe steep already turning, from behind,\\nRush\\'d on.  With fury and like random rout,\\nAs echoing on their shores at midnight heard\\nIsmenus and Asopus, for his Thebes\\nIf Bacchus\\' help were needed; so came these\\nTumultuous, curving each his rapid step,\\nBy eagerness impell\\'d of holy love.\\n\\nSoon they o\\'ertook us; with such swiftness mov\\'d\\nThe mighty crowd.  Two spirits at their head\\nCried weeping; \"Blessed Mary sought with haste\\nThe hilly region.  Caesar to subdue\\nIlerda, darted in Marseilles his sting,\\nAnd flew to Spain.\"--\"Oh tarry not: away;\"\\nThe others shouted; \"let not time be lost\\nThrough slackness of affection.  Hearty zeal\\nTo serve reanimates celestial grace.\"\\n\\n\"O ye, in whom intenser fervency\\nHaply supplies, where lukewarm erst ye fail\\'d,\\nSlow or neglectful, to absolve your part\\nOf good and virtuous, this man, who yet lives,\\n(Credit my tale, though strange) desires t\\' ascend,\\nSo morning rise to light us.  Therefore say\\nWhich hand leads nearest to the rifted rock?\"\\n\\nSo spake my guide, to whom a shade return\\'d:\\n\"Come after us, and thou shalt find the cleft.\\nWe may not linger: such resistless will\\nSpeeds our unwearied course.  Vouchsafe us then\\nThy pardon, if our duty seem to thee\\nDiscourteous rudeness.  In Verona I\\nWas abbot of San Zeno, when the hand\\nOf Barbarossa grasp\\'d Imperial sway,\\nThat name, ne\\'er utter\\'d without tears in Milan.\\nAnd there is he, hath one foot in his grave,\\nWho for that monastery ere long shall weep,\\nRuing his power misus\\'d: for that his son,\\nOf body ill compact, and worse in mind,\\nAnd born in evil, he hath set in place\\nOf its true pastor.\"  Whether more he spake,\\nOr here was mute, I know not: he had sped\\nE\\'en now so far beyond us.  Yet thus much\\nI heard, and in rememb\\'rance treasur\\'d it.\\n\\nHe then, who never fail\\'d me at my need,\\nCried, \"Hither turn.  Lo! two with sharp remorse\\nChiding their sin!\"  In rear of all the troop\\nThese shouted: \"First they died, to whom the sea\\nOpen\\'d, or ever Jordan saw his heirs:\\nAnd they, who with Aeneas to the end\\nEndur\\'d not suffering, for their portion chose\\nLife without glory.\"  Soon as they had fled\\nPast reach of sight, new thought within me rose\\nBy others follow\\'d fast, and each unlike\\nIts fellow: till led on from thought to thought,\\nAnd pleasur\\'d with the fleeting train, mine eye\\nWas clos\\'d, and meditation chang\\'d to dream.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XIX\\n\\nIt was the hour, when of diurnal heat\\nNo reliques chafe the cold beams of the moon,\\nO\\'erpower\\'d by earth, or planetary sway\\nOf Saturn; and the geomancer sees\\nHis Greater Fortune up the east ascend,\\nWhere gray dawn checkers first the shadowy cone;\\nWhen \\'fore me in my dream a woman\\'s shape\\nThere came, with lips that stammer\\'d, eyes aslant,\\nDistorted feet, hands maim\\'d, and colour pale.\\n\\nI look\\'d upon her; and as sunshine cheers\\nLimbs numb\\'d by nightly cold, e\\'en thus my look\\nUnloos\\'d her tongue, next in brief space her form\\nDecrepit rais\\'d erect, and faded face\\nWith love\\'s own hue illum\\'d. Recov\\'ring speech\\nShe forthwith warbling such a strain began,\\nThat I, how loth soe\\'er, could scarce have held\\nAttention from the song.  \"I,\" thus she sang,\\n\"I am the Siren, she, whom mariners\\nOn the wide sea are wilder\\'d when they hear:\\nSuch fulness of delight the list\\'ner feels.\\nI from his course Ulysses by my lay\\nEnchanted drew.  Whoe\\'er frequents me once\\nParts seldom; so I charm him, and his heart\\nContented knows no void.\"  Or ere her mouth\\nWas clos\\'d, to shame her at her side appear\\'d\\nA dame of semblance holy.  With stern voice\\nShe utter\\'d; \"Say, O Virgil, who is this?\"\\nWhich hearing, he approach\\'d, with eyes still bent\\nToward that goodly presence: th\\' other seiz\\'d her,\\nAnd, her robes tearing, open\\'d her before,\\nAnd show\\'d the belly to me, whence a smell,\\nExhaling loathsome, wak\\'d me.  Round I turn\\'d\\nMine eyes, and thus the teacher: \"At the least\\nThree times my voice hath call\\'d thee.  Rise, begone.\\nLet us the opening find where thou mayst pass.\"\\n\\nI straightway rose.  Now day, pour\\'d down from high,\\nFill\\'d all the circuits of the sacred mount;\\nAnd, as we journey\\'d, on our shoulder smote\\nThe early ray.  I follow\\'d, stooping low\\nMy forehead, as a man, o\\'ercharg\\'d with thought,\\nWho bends him to the likeness of an arch,\\nThat midway spans the flood; when thus I heard,\\n\"Come, enter here,\" in tone so soft and mild,\\nAs never met the ear on mortal strand.\\n\\nWith swan-like wings dispread and pointing up,\\nWho thus had spoken marshal\\'d us along,\\nWhere each side of the solid masonry\\nThe sloping, walls retir\\'d; then mov\\'d his plumes,\\nAnd fanning us, affirm\\'d that those, who mourn,\\nAre blessed, for that comfort shall be theirs.\\n\\n\"What aileth thee, that still thou look\\'st to earth?\"\\nBegan my leader; while th\\' angelic shape\\nA little over us his station took.\\n\\n\"New vision,\" I replied, \"hath rais\\'d in me\\nSurmisings strange and anxious doubts, whereon\\nMy soul intent allows no other thought\\nOr room or entrance.\"--\"Hast thou seen,\" said he,\\n\"That old enchantress, her, whose wiles alone\\nThe spirits o\\'er us weep for?  Hast thou seen\\nHow man may free him of her bonds?  Enough.\\nLet thy heels spurn the earth, and thy rais\\'d ken\\nFix on the lure, which heav\\'n\\'s eternal King\\nWhirls in the rolling spheres.\"  As on his feet\\nThe falcon first looks down, then to the sky\\nTurns, and forth stretches eager for the food,\\nThat woos him thither; so the call I heard,\\nSo onward, far as the dividing rock\\nGave way, I journey\\'d, till the plain was reach\\'d.\\n\\nOn the fifth circle when I stood at large,\\nA race appear\\'d before me, on the ground\\nAll downward lying prone and weeping sore.\\n\"My soul hath cleaved to the dust,\" I heard\\nWith sighs so deep, they well nigh choak\\'d the words.\\n\"O ye elect of God, whose penal woes\\nBoth hope and justice mitigate, direct\\nTow\\'rds the steep rising our uncertain way.\"\\n\\n\"If ye approach secure from this our doom,\\nProstration--and would urge your course with speed,\\nSee that ye still to rightward keep the brink.\"\\n\\nSo them the bard besought; and such the words,\\nBeyond us some short space, in answer came.\\n\\nI noted what remain\\'d yet hidden from them:\\nThence to my liege\\'s eyes mine eyes I bent,\\nAnd he, forthwith interpreting their suit,\\nBeckon\\'d his glad assent. Free then to act,\\nAs pleas\\'d me, I drew near, and took my stand\\nO`er that shade, whose words I late had mark\\'d.\\nAnd, \"Spirit!\"  I said, \"in whom repentant tears\\nMature that blessed hour, when thou with God\\nShalt find acceptance, for a while suspend\\nFor me that mightier care.  Say who thou wast,\\nWhy thus ye grovel on your bellies prone,\\nAnd if in aught ye wish my service there,\\nWhence living I am come.\"  He answering spake\\n\"The cause why Heav\\'n our back toward his cope\\nReverses, shalt thou know: but me know first\\nThe successor of Peter, and the name\\nAnd title of my lineage from that stream,\\nThat\\' twixt Chiaveri and Siestri draws\\nHis limpid waters through the lowly glen.\\nA month and little more by proof I learnt,\\nWith what a weight that robe of sov\\'reignty\\nUpon his shoulder rests, who from the mire\\nWould guard it: that each other fardel seems\\nBut feathers in the balance.

Thou didst, as one,\\nWho, journeying through the darkness, hears a light\\nBehind, that profits not himself, but makes\\nHis followers wise, when thou exclaimedst, \\'Lo!\\nA renovated world!

There ofttimes\\nWe of that mount hold converse, on whose top\\nFor aye our nurses live.  We have the bard\\nOf Pella, and the Teian, Agatho,\\nSimonides, and many a Grecian else\\nIngarlanded with laurel.

Four handmaids of the day\\nHad finish\\'d now their office, and the fifth\\nWas at the chariot-beam, directing still\\nIts balmy point aloof, when thus my guide:\\n\"Methinks, it well behooves us to the brink\\nBend the right shoulder\\' circuiting the mount,\\nAs we have ever us\\'d.\"  So custom there\\nWas usher to the road, the which we chose\\nLess doubtful, as that worthy shade complied.\\n\\nThey on before me went; I sole pursued,\\nList\\'ning their speech, that to my thoughts convey\\'d\\nMysterious lessons of sweet poesy.\\nBut soon they ceas\\'d; for midway of the road\\nA tree we found, with goodly fruitage hung,\\nAnd pleasant to the smell: and as a fir\\nUpward from bough to bough less ample spreads,\\nSo downward this less ample spread, that none.\\nMethinks, aloft may climb.  Upon the side,\\nThat clos\\'d our path, a liquid crystal fell\\nFrom the steep rock, and through the sprays above\\nStream\\'d showering.  With associate step the bards\\nDrew near the plant; and from amidst the leaves\\nA voice was heard: \"Ye shall be chary of me;\"\\nAnd after added: \"Mary took more thought\\nFor joy and honour of the nuptial feast,\\nThan for herself who answers now for you.\\nThe women of old Rome were satisfied\\nWith water for their beverage.

I do not think\\nThus dry and meagre Erisicthon show\\'d,\\nWhen pinc\\'ed by sharp-set famine to the quick.\\n\\n\"Lo!\" to myself I mus\\'d, \"the race, who lost\\nJerusalem, when Mary with dire beak\\nPrey\\'d on her child.\"  The sockets seem\\'d as rings,\\nFrom which the gems were drops.  Who reads the name\\nOf man upon his forehead, there the M\\nHad trac\\'d most plainly.  Who would deem, that scent\\nOf water and an apple, could have prov\\'d\\nPowerful to generate such pining want,\\nNot knowing how it wrought?  While now I stood\\nWond\\'ring what thus could waste them (for the cause\\nOf their gaunt hollowness and scaly rind\\nAppear\\'d not) lo! a spirit turn\\'d his eyes\\nIn their deep-sunken cell, and fasten\\'d then\\nOn me, then cried with vehemence aloud:\\n\"What grace is this vouchsaf\\'d me?\"  By his looks\\nI ne\\'er had recogniz\\'d him: but the voice\\nBrought to my knowledge what his cheer conceal\\'d.\\nRemembrance of his alter\\'d lineaments\\nWas kindled from that spark; and I agniz\\'d\\nThe visage of Forese.  \"Ah! respect\\nThis wan and leprous wither\\'d skin,\" thus he\\nSuppliant implor\\'d, \"this macerated flesh.\\nSpeak to me truly of thyself.  And who\\nAre those twain spirits, that escort thee there?\\nBe it not said thou Scorn\\'st to talk with me.\"\\n\\n\"That face of thine,\" I answer\\'d him, \"which dead\\nI once bewail\\'d, disposes me not less\\nFor weeping, when I see It thus transform\\'d.\\nSay then, by Heav\\'n, what blasts ye thus?

The odour, which the fruit,\\nAnd spray, that showers upon the verdure, breathe,\\nInflames us with desire to feed and drink.\\nNor once alone encompassing our route\\nWe come to add fresh fuel to the pain:\\nPain, said Iolace rather: for that will\\nTo the tree leads us, by which Christ was led\\nTo call Elias, joyful when he paid\\nOur ransom from his vein.\"  I answering thus:\\n\"Forese! from that day, in which the world\\nFor better life thou changedst, not five years\\nHave circled.  If the power of sinning more\\nWere first concluded in thee, ere thou knew\\'st\\nThat kindly grief, which re-espouses us\\nTo God, how hither art thou come so soon?\\nI thought to find thee lower, there, where time\\nIs recompense for time.\"  He straight replied:\\n\"To drink up the sweet wormwood of affliction\\nI have been brought thus early by the tears\\nStream\\'d down my Nella\\'s cheeks.

This,\" and his finger then he rais\\'d,\\n\"Is Buonaggiuna,--Buonaggiuna, he\\nOf Lucca: and that face beyond him, pierc\\'d\\nUnto a leaner fineness than the rest,\\nHad keeping of the church: he was of Tours,\\nAnd purges by wan abstinence away\\nBolsena\\'s eels and cups of muscadel.\"\\n\\nHe show\\'d me many others, one by one,\\nAnd all, as they were nam\\'d, seem\\'d well content;\\nFor no dark gesture I discern\\'d in any.\\nI saw through hunger Ubaldino grind\\nHis teeth on emptiness; and Boniface,\\nThat wav\\'d the crozier o\\'er a num\\'rous flock.\\nI saw the Marquis, who tad time erewhile\\nTo swill at Forli with less drought, yet so\\nWas one ne\\'er sated.  I howe\\'er, like him,\\nThat gazing \\'midst a crowd, singles out one,\\nSo singled him of Lucca; for methought\\nWas none amongst them took such note of me.\\nSomewhat I heard him whisper of Gentucca:\\nThe sound was indistinct, and murmur\\'d there,\\nWhere justice, that so strips them, fix\\'d her sting.\\n\\n\"Spirit!\" said I, \"it seems as thou wouldst fain\\nSpeak with me.

If aught false\\nMy whisper too implied, th\\' event shall tell\\nBut say, if of a  truth I see the man\\nOf that new lay th\\' inventor, which begins\\nWith \\'Ladies, ye that con the lore of love\\'.\"\\n\\nTo whom I thus: \"Count of me but as one\\nWho am the scribe of love; that, when he breathes,\\nTake up my pen, and, as he dictates, write.\"\\n\\n\"Brother!\" said he, \"the hind\\'rance which once held\\nThe notary with Guittone and myself,\\nShort of that new and sweeter style I hear,\\nIs now disclos\\'d.  I see how ye your plumes\\nStretch, as th\\' inditer guides them; which, no question,\\nOurs did not.  He that seeks a grace beyond,\\nSees not the distance parts one style from other.\"\\nAnd, as contented, here he held his peace.\\n\\nLike as the bird, that winter near the Nile,\\nIn squared regiment direct their course,\\nThen stretch themselves in file for speedier flight;\\nThus all the tribe of spirits, as they turn\\'d\\nTheir visage, faster deaf, nimble alike\\nThrough leanness and desire.  And as a man,\\nTir\\'d With the motion of a trotting steed,\\nSlacks pace, and stays behind his company,\\nTill his o\\'erbreathed lungs keep temperate time;\\nE\\'en so Forese let that holy crew\\nProceed, behind them lingering at my side,\\nAnd saying: \"When shall I again behold thee?\"\\n\\n\"How long my life may last,\" said I, \"I know not;\\nThis know, how soon soever I return,\\nMy wishes will before me have arriv\\'d.\\nSithence the place, where I am set to live,\\nIs, day by day, more scoop\\'d of all its good,\\nAnd dismal ruin seems to threaten it.\"\\n\\n\"Go now,\" he cried: \"lo! he, whose guilt is most,\\nPasses before my vision, dragg\\'d at heels\\nOf an infuriate beast.

E\\'en as our steps\\nTurn\\'d thither, not far off it rose to view.\\nBeneath it were a multitude, that rais\\'d\\nTheir hands, and shouted forth I know not What\\nUnto the boughs; like greedy and fond brats,\\nThat beg, and answer none obtain from him,\\nOf whom they beg; but more to draw them on,\\nHe at arm\\'s length the object of their wish\\nAbove them holds aloft, and hides it not.\\n\\nAt length, as undeceiv\\'d they went their way:\\nAnd we approach the tree, who vows and tears\\nSue to in vain, the mighty tree.  \"Pass on,\\nAnd come not near.  Stands higher up the wood,\\nWhereof Eve tasted, and from it was ta\\'en\\n\\'this plant.\" Such sounds from midst the thickets came.\\nWhence I, with either bard, close to the side\\nThat rose, pass\\'d forth beyond.  \"Remember,\" next\\nWe heard, \"those noblest creatures of the clouds,\\nHow they their twofold bosoms overgorg\\'d\\nOppos\\'d in fight to Theseus: call to mind\\nThe Hebrews, how effeminate they stoop\\'d\\nTo ease their thirst; whence Gideon\\'s ranks were thinn\\'d,\\nAs he to Midian march\\'d adown the hills.\"\\n\\nThus near one border coasting, still we heard\\nThe sins of gluttony, with woe erewhile\\nReguerdon\\'d.  Then along the lonely path,\\nOnce more at large, full thousand paces on\\nWe travel\\'d, each contemplative and mute.\\n\\n\"Why pensive journey thus ye three alone?\"\\nThus suddenly a voice exclaim\\'d: whereat\\nI shook, as doth a scar\\'d and paltry beast;\\nThen rais\\'d my head to look from whence it came.\\n\\nWas ne\\'er, in furnace, glass, or metal seen\\nSo bright and glowing red, as was the shape\\nI now beheld.  \"If ye desire to mount,\"\\nHe cried, \"here must ye turn.  This way he goes,\\nWho goes in quest of peace.\"  His countenance\\nHad dazzled me; and to my guides I fac\\'d\\nBackward, like one who walks, as sound directs.\\n\\nAs when, to harbinger the dawn, springs up\\nOn freshen\\'d wing the air of May, and breathes\\nOf fragrance, all impregn\\'d with herb and flowers,\\nE\\'en such a wind I felt upon my front\\nBlow gently, and the moving of a wing\\nPerceiv\\'d, that moving shed ambrosial smell;\\nAnd then a voice: \"Blessed are they, whom grace\\nDoth so illume, that appetite in them\\nExhaleth no inordinate desire,\\nStill hung\\'ring as the rule of temperance wills.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXV\\n\\nIt was an hour, when he who climbs, had need\\nTo walk uncrippled: for the sun had now\\nTo Taurus the meridian circle left,\\nAnd to the Scorpion left the night.  As one\\nThat makes no pause, but presses on his road,\\nWhate\\'er betide him, if some urgent need\\nImpel: so enter\\'d we upon our way,\\nOne before other; for, but singly, none\\nThat steep and narrow scale admits to climb.\\n\\nE\\'en as the young stork lifteth up his wing\\nThrough wish to fly, yet ventures not to quit\\nThe nest, and drops it; so in me desire\\nOf questioning my guide arose, and fell,\\nArriving even to the act, that marks\\nA man prepar\\'d for speech.  Him all our haste\\nRestrain\\'d not, but thus spake the sire belov\\'d:\\nFear not to speed the shaft, that on thy lip\\nStands trembling for its flight.  Encourag\\'d thus\\nI straight began: \"How there can leanness come,\\nWhere is no want of nourishment to feed?\"\\n\\n\"If thou,\" he answer\\'d, \"hadst remember\\'d thee,\\nHow Meleager with the wasting brand\\nWasted alike, by equal fires consum\\'d,\\nThis would not trouble thee: and hadst thou thought,\\nHow in the mirror your reflected form\\nWith mimic motion vibrates, what now seems\\nHard, had appear\\'d no harder than the pulp\\nOf summer fruit mature.  But that thy will\\nIn certainty may find its full repose,\\nLo Statius here! on him I call, and pray\\nThat he would now be healer of thy wound.\"\\n\\n\"If in thy presence I unfold to him\\nThe secrets of heaven\\'s vengeance, let me plead\\nThine own injunction, to exculpate me.\"\\nSo Statius answer\\'d, and forthwith began:\\n\"Attend my words, O son, and in thy mind\\nReceive them: so shall they be light to clear\\nThe doubt thou offer\\'st. Blood, concocted well,\\nWhich by the thirsty veins is ne\\'er imbib\\'d,\\nAnd rests as food superfluous, to be ta\\'en\\nFrom the replenish\\'d table, in the heart\\nDerives effectual virtue, that informs\\nThe several human limbs, as being that,\\nWhich passes through the veins itself to make them.\\nYet more concocted it descends, where shame\\nForbids to mention: and from thence distils\\nIn natural vessel on another\\'s blood.\\nThen each unite together, one dispos\\'d\\nT\\' endure, to act the other, through meet frame\\nOf its recipient mould: that being reach\\'d,\\nIt \\'gins to work, coagulating first;\\nThen vivifies what its own substance caus\\'d\\nTo bear.  With animation now indued,\\nThe active virtue (differing from a plant\\nNo further, than that this is on the way\\nAnd at its limit that) continues yet\\nTo operate, that now it moves, and feels,\\nAs sea sponge clinging to the rock: and there\\nAssumes th\\' organic powers its seed convey\\'d.\\n\\'This is the period, son! at which the virtue,\\nThat from the generating heart proceeds,\\nIs pliant and expansive; for each limb\\nIs in the heart by forgeful nature plann\\'d.\\nHow babe of animal becomes, remains\\nFor thy consid\\'ring.  At this point, more wise,\\nThan thou hast err\\'d, making the soul disjoin\\'d\\nFrom passive intellect, because he saw\\nNo organ for the latter\\'s use assign\\'d.\\n\\n\"Open thy bosom to the truth that comes.\\nKnow soon as in the embryo, to the brain,\\nArticulation is complete, then turns\\nThe primal Mover with a smile of joy\\nOn such great work of nature, and imbreathes\\nNew spirit replete with virtue, that what here\\nActive it finds, to its own substance draws,\\nAnd forms an individual soul, that lives,\\nAnd feels, and bends reflective on itself.\\nAnd that thou less mayst marvel at the word,\\nMark the sun\\'s heat, how that to wine doth change,\\nMix\\'d with the moisture filter\\'d through the vine.\\n\\n\"When Lachesis hath spun the thread, the soul\\nTakes with her both the human and divine,\\nMemory, intelligence, and will, in act\\nFar keener than before, the other powers\\nInactive all and mute.  No pause allow\\'d,\\nIn wond\\'rous sort self-moving, to one strand\\nOf those, where the departed roam, she falls,\\nHere learns her destin\\'d path.  Soon as the place\\nReceives her, round the plastic virtue beams,\\nDistinct as in the living limbs before:\\nAnd as the air, when saturate with showers,\\nThe casual beam refracting, decks itself\\nWith many a hue; so here the ambient air\\nWeareth that form, which influence of the soul\\nImprints on it; and like the flame, that where\\nThe fire moves, thither follows, so henceforth\\nThe new form on the spirit follows still:\\nHence hath it semblance, and is shadow call\\'d,\\nWith each sense even to the sight endued:\\nHence speech is ours, hence laughter, tears, and sighs\\nWhich thou mayst oft have witness\\'d on the mount\\nTh\\' obedient shadow fails not to present\\nWhatever varying passion moves within us.\\nAnd this the cause of what thou marvel\\'st at.\"\\n\\nNow the last flexure of our way we reach\\'d,\\nAnd to the right hand turning, other care\\nAwaits us.  Here the rocky precipice\\nHurls forth redundant flames, and from the rim\\nA blast upblown, with forcible rebuff\\nDriveth them back, sequester\\'d from its bound.\\n\\nBehoov\\'d us, one by one, along the side,\\nThat border\\'d on the void, to pass; and I\\nFear\\'d on one hand the fire, on th\\' other fear\\'d\\nHeadlong to fall: when thus th\\' instructor warn\\'d:\\n\"Strict rein must in this place direct the eyes.\\nA little swerving and the way is lost.\"\\n\\nThen from the bosom of the burning mass,\\n\"O God of mercy!\" heard I sung; and felt\\nNo less desire to turn.  And when I saw\\nSpirits along the flame proceeding, I\\nBetween their footsteps and mine own was fain\\nTo share by turns my view.  At the hymn\\'s close\\nThey shouted loud, \"I do not know a man;\"\\nThen in low voice again took up the strain,\\nWhich once more ended, \"To the wood,\" they cried,\\n\"Ran Dian, and drave forth Callisto, stung\\nWith Cytherea\\'s poison:\" then return\\'d\\nUnto their song; then marry a pair extoll\\'d,\\nWho liv\\'d in virtue chastely, and the bands\\nOf wedded love.  Nor from that task, I ween,\\nSurcease they; whilesoe\\'er the scorching fire\\nEnclasps them.  Of such skill appliance needs\\nTo medicine the wound, that healeth last.\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXVI\\n\\nWhile singly thus along the rim we walk\\'d,\\nOft the good master warn\\'d me: \"Look thou well.\\nAvail it that I caution thee.\"  The sun\\nNow all the western clime irradiate chang\\'d\\nFrom azure tinct to white; and, as I pass\\'d,\\nMy passing shadow made the umber\\'d flame\\nBurn ruddier.  At so strange a sight I mark\\'d\\nThat many a spirit marvel\\'d on his way.\\n\\nThis bred occasion first to speak of me,\\n\"He seems,\" said they, \"no insubstantial frame:\"\\nThen to obtain what certainty they might,\\nStretch\\'d towards me, careful not to overpass\\nThe burning pale.  \"O thou, who followest\\nThe others, haply not more slow than they,\\nBut mov\\'d by rev\\'rence, answer me, who burn\\nIn thirst and fire: nor I alone, but these\\nAll for thine answer do more thirst, than doth\\nIndian or Aethiop for the cooling stream.\\nTell us, how is it that thou mak\\'st thyself\\nA wall against the sun, as thou not yet\\nInto th\\' inextricable toils of death\\nHadst enter\\'d?\"  Thus spake one, and I had straight\\nDeclar\\'d me, if attention had not turn\\'d\\nTo new appearance.  Meeting these, there came,\\nMidway the burning path, a crowd, on whom\\nEarnestly gazing, from each part I view\\nThe shadows all press forward, sev\\'rally\\nEach snatch a hasty kiss, and then away.\\nE\\'en so the emmets, \\'mid their dusky troops,\\nPeer closely one at other, to spy out\\nTheir mutual road perchance, and how they thrive.\\n\\nThat friendly greeting parted, ere dispatch\\nOf the first onward step, from either tribe\\nLoud clamour rises: those, who newly come,\\nShout \"Sodom and Gomorrah!\" these, \"The cow\\nPasiphae enter\\'d, that the beast she woo\\'d\\nMight rush unto her luxury.\"  Then as cranes,\\nThat part towards the Riphaean mountains fly,\\nPart towards the Lybic sands, these to avoid\\nThe ice, and those the sun; so hasteth off\\nOne crowd, advances th\\' other; and resume\\nTheir first song weeping, and their several shout.\\n\\nAgain drew near my side the very same,\\nWho had erewhile besought me, and their looks\\nMark\\'d eagerness to listen.  I, who twice\\nTheir will had noted, spake: \"O spirits secure,\\nWhene\\'er the time may be, of peaceful end!\\nMy limbs, nor crude, nor in mature old age,\\nHave I left yonder: here they bear me, fed\\nWith blood, and sinew-strung.  That I no more\\nMay live in blindness, hence I tend aloft.\\nThere is a dame on high, who wind for us\\nThis grace, by which my mortal through your realm\\nI bear.  But may your utmost wish soon meet\\nSuch full fruition, that the orb of heaven,\\nFullest of love, and of most ample space,\\nReceive you, as ye tell (upon my page\\nHenceforth to stand recorded) who ye are,\\nAnd what this multitude, that at your backs\\nHave past behind us.\"  As one, mountain-bred,\\nRugged and clownish, if some city\\'s walls\\nHe chance to enter, round him stares agape,\\nConfounded and struck dumb; e\\'en such appear\\'d\\nEach spirit.  But when rid of that amaze,\\n(Not long the inmate of a noble heart)\\nHe, who before had question\\'d, thus resum\\'d:\\n\"O blessed, who, for death preparing, tak\\'st\\nExperience of our limits, in thy bark!\\nTheir crime, who not with us proceed, was that,\\nFor which, as he did triumph, Caesar heard\\nThe snout of \\'queen,\\' to taunt him.  Hence their cry\\nOf \\'Sodom,\\' as they parted, to rebuke\\nThemselves, and aid the burning by their shame.\\nOur sinning was Hermaphrodite: but we,\\nBecause the law of human kind we broke,\\nFollowing like beasts our vile concupiscence,\\nHence parting from them, to our own disgrace\\nRecord the name of her, by whom the beast\\nIn bestial tire was acted.  Now our deeds\\nThou know\\'st, and how we sinn\\'d.  If thou by name\\nWouldst haply know us, time permits not now\\nTo tell so much, nor can I.  Of myself\\nLearn what thou wishest.  Guinicelli I,\\nWho having truly sorrow\\'d ere my last,\\nAlready cleanse me.\"  With such pious joy,\\nAs the two sons upon their mother gaz\\'d\\nFrom sad Lycurgus rescu\\'d, such my joy\\n(Save that I more represt it) when I heard\\nFrom his own lips the name of him pronounc\\'d,\\nWho was a father to me, and to those\\nMy betters, who have ever us\\'d the sweet\\nAnd pleasant rhymes of love.  So nought I heard\\nNor spake, but long time thoughtfully I went,\\nGazing on him; and, only for the fire,\\nApproach\\'d not nearer.  When my eyes were fed\\nBy looking on him, with such solemn pledge,\\nAs forces credence, I devoted me\\nUnto his service wholly.  In reply\\nHe thus bespake me: \"What from thee I hear\\nIs grav\\'d so deeply on my mind, the waves\\nOf Lethe shall not wash it off, nor make\\nA whit less lively.  But as now thy oath\\nHas seal\\'d the truth, declare what cause impels\\nThat love, which both thy looks and speech bewray.\"\\n\\n\"Those dulcet lays,\" I answer\\'d, \"which, as long\\nAs of our tongue the beauty does not fade,\\nShall make us love the very ink that trac\\'d them.\"\\n\\n\"Brother!\"  he cried, and pointed at a shade\\nBefore him, \"there is one, whose mother speech\\nDoth owe to him a fairer ornament.\\nHe in love ditties and the tales of prose\\nWithout a rival stands, and lets the fools\\nTalk on, who think the songster of Limoges\\nO\\'ertops him.  Rumour and the popular voice\\nThey look to more than truth, and so confirm\\nOpinion, ere by art or reason taught.\\nThus many of the elder time cried up\\nGuittone, giving him the prize, till truth\\nBy strength of numbers vanquish\\'d.  If thou own\\nSo ample privilege, as to have gain\\'d\\nFree entrance to the cloister, whereof Christ\\nIs Abbot of the college, say to him\\nOne paternoster for me, far as needs\\nFor dwellers in this world, where power to sin\\nNo longer tempts us.\"  Haply to make way\\nFor one, that follow\\'d next, when that was said,\\nHe vanish\\'d through the fire, as through the wave\\nA fish, that glances diving to the deep.\\n\\nI, to the spirit he had shown me, drew\\nA little onward, and besought his name,\\nFor which my heart, I said, kept gracious room.\\nHe frankly thus began: \"Thy courtesy\\nSo wins on me, I have nor power nor will\\nTo hide me.  I am Arnault; and with songs,\\nSorely lamenting for my folly past,\\nThorough this ford of fire I wade, and see\\nThe day, I hope for, smiling in my view.\\nI pray ye by the worth that guides ye up\\nUnto the summit of the scale, in time\\nRemember ye my suff\\'rings.\"  With such words\\nHe disappear\\'d in the refining flame.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXVII\\n\\nNow was the sun so station\\'d, as when first\\nHis early radiance quivers on the heights,\\nWhere stream\\'d his Maker\\'s blood, while Libra hangs\\nAbove Hesperian Ebro, and new fires\\nMeridian flash on Ganges\\' yellow tide.\\n\\nSo day was sinking, when the\\' angel of God\\nAppear\\'d before us.  Joy was in his mien.\\nForth of the flame he stood upon the brink,\\nAnd with a voice, whose lively clearness far\\nSurpass\\'d our human, \"Blessed are the pure\\nIn heart,\" he Sang: then near him as we came,\\n\"Go ye not further, holy spirits!\"  he cried,\\n\"Ere the fire pierce you: enter in; and list\\nAttentive to the song ye hear from thence.\"\\n\\nI, when I heard his saying, was as one\\nLaid in the grave.  My hands together clasp\\'d,\\nAnd upward stretching, on the fire I look\\'d,\\nAnd busy fancy conjur\\'d up the forms\\nErewhile beheld alive consum\\'d in flames.\\n\\nTh\\' escorting spirits turn\\'d with gentle looks\\nToward me, and the Mantuan spake: \"My son,\\nHere torment thou mayst feel, but canst not death.\\nRemember thee, remember thee, if I\\nSafe e\\'en on Geryon brought thee: now I come\\nMore near to God, wilt thou not trust me now?\\nOf this be sure: though in its womb that flame\\nA thousand years contain\\'d thee, from thy head\\nNo hair should perish.  If thou doubt my truth,\\nApproach, and with thy hands thy vesture\\'s hem\\nStretch forth, and for thyself confirm belief.\\nLay now all fear, O lay all fear aside.\\nTurn hither, and come onward undismay\\'d.\"\\nI still, though conscience urg\\'d\\' no step advanc\\'d.\\n\\nWhen still he saw me fix\\'d and obstinate,\\nSomewhat disturb\\'d he cried: \"Mark now, my son,\\nFrom Beatrice thou art by this wall\\nDivided.\"  As at Thisbe\\'s name the eye\\nOf Pyramus was open\\'d (when life ebb\\'d\\nFast from his veins), and took one parting glance,\\nWhile vermeil dyed the mulberry; thus I turn\\'d\\nTo my sage guide, relenting, when I heard\\nThe name, that springs forever in my breast.\\n\\nHe shook his forehead; and, \"How long,\" he said,\\n\"Linger we now?\"  then smil\\'d, as one would smile\\nUpon a child, that eyes the fruit and yields.\\nInto the fire before me then he walk\\'d;\\nAnd Statius, who erewhile no little space\\nHad parted us, he pray\\'d to come behind.\\n\\nI would have cast me into molten glass\\nTo cool me, when I enter\\'d; so intense\\nRag\\'d the conflagrant mass.  The sire belov\\'d,\\nTo comfort me, as he proceeded, still\\nOf Beatrice talk\\'d.  \"Her eyes,\" saith he,\\n\"E\\'en now I seem to view.\"  From the other side\\nA voice, that sang, did guide us, and the voice\\nFollowing, with heedful ear, we issued forth,\\nThere where the path led upward.  \"Come,\" we heard,\\n\"Come, blessed of my Father.\"  Such the sounds,\\nThat hail\\'d us from within a light, which shone\\nSo radiant, I could not endure the view.\\n\"The sun,\" it added, \"hastes: and evening comes.\\nDelay not: ere the western sky is hung\\nWith blackness, strive ye for the pass.\"  Our way\\nUpright within the rock arose, and fac\\'d\\nSuch part of heav\\'n, that from before my steps\\nThe beams were shrouded of the sinking sun.\\n\\nNor many stairs were overpass, when now\\nBy fading of the shadow we perceiv\\'d\\nThe sun behind us couch\\'d: and ere one face\\nOf darkness o\\'er its measureless expanse\\nInvolv\\'d th\\' horizon, and the night her lot\\nHeld individual, each of us had made\\nA stair his pallet: not that will, but power,\\nHad fail\\'d us, by the nature of that mount\\nForbidden further travel.  As the goats,\\nThat late have skipp\\'d and wanton\\'d rapidly\\nUpon the craggy cliffs, ere they had ta\\'en\\nTheir supper on the herb, now silent lie\\nAnd ruminate beneath the umbrage brown,\\nWhile noonday rages; and the goatherd leans\\nUpon his staff, and leaning watches them:\\nAnd as the swain, that lodges out all night\\nIn quiet by his flock, lest beast of prey\\nDisperse them; even so all three abode,\\nI as a goat and as the shepherds they,\\nClose pent on either side by shelving rock.\\n\\nA little glimpse of sky was seen above;\\nYet by that little I beheld the stars\\nIn magnitude and rustle shining forth\\nWith more than wonted glory.  As I lay,\\nGazing on them, and in that fit of musing,\\nSleep overcame me, sleep, that bringeth oft\\nTidings of future hap.  About the hour,\\nAs I believe, when Venus from the east\\nFirst lighten\\'d on the mountain, she whose orb\\nSeems always glowing with the fire of love,\\nA lady young and beautiful, I dream\\'d,\\nWas passing o\\'er a lea; and, as she came,\\nMethought I saw her ever and anon\\nBending to cull the flowers; and thus she sang:\\n\"Know ye, whoever of my name would ask,\\nThat I am Leah: for my brow to weave\\nA garland, these fair hands unwearied ply.\\nTo please me at the crystal mirror, here\\nI deck me.  But my sister Rachel, she\\nBefore her glass abides the livelong day,\\nHer radiant eyes beholding, charm\\'d no less,\\nThan I with this delightful task.  Her joy\\nIn contemplation, as in labour mine.\"\\n\\nAnd now as glimm\\'ring dawn appear\\'d, that breaks\\nMore welcome to the pilgrim still, as he\\nSojourns less distant on his homeward way,\\nDarkness from all sides fled, and with it fled\\nMy slumber; whence I rose and saw my guide\\nAlready risen.  \"That delicious fruit,\\nWhich through so many a branch the zealous care\\nOf mortals roams in quest of, shall this day\\nAppease thy hunger.\"  Such the words I heard\\nFrom Virgil\\'s lip; and never greeting heard\\nSo pleasant as the sounds.  Within me straight\\nDesire so grew upon desire to mount,\\nThenceforward at each step I felt the wings\\nIncreasing for my flight.  When we had run\\nO\\'er all the ladder to its topmost round,\\nAs there we stood, on me the Mantuan fix\\'d\\nHis eyes, and thus he spake: \"Both fires, my son,\\nThe temporal and eternal, thou hast seen,\\nAnd art arriv\\'d, where of itself my ken\\nNo further reaches.  I with skill and art\\nThus far have drawn thee.  Now thy pleasure take\\nFor guide.  Thou hast o\\'ercome the steeper way,\\nO\\'ercome the straighter.  Lo! the sun, that darts\\nHis beam upon thy forehead! lo! the herb,\\nThe arboreta and flowers, which of itself\\nThis land pours forth profuse!  Will those bright eyes\\nWith gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste\\nTo succour thee, thou mayst or seat thee down,\\nOr wander where thou wilt.  Expect no more\\nSanction of warning voice or sign from me,\\nFree of thy own arbitrement to choose,\\nDiscreet, judicious.  To distrust thy sense\\nWere henceforth error.  I invest thee then\\nWith crown and mitre, sovereign o\\'er thyself.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXVIII\\n\\nThrough that celestial forest, whose thick shade\\nWith lively greenness the new-springing day\\nAttemper\\'d, eager now to roam, and search\\nIts limits round, forthwith I left the bank,\\nAlong the champain leisurely my way\\nPursuing, o\\'er the ground, that on all sides\\nDelicious odour breath\\'d.  A pleasant air,\\nThat intermitted never, never veer\\'d,\\nSmote on my temples, gently, as a wind\\nOf softest influence: at which the sprays,\\nObedient all, lean\\'d trembling to that part\\nWhere first the holy mountain casts his shade,\\nYet were not so disorder\\'d, but that still\\nUpon their top the feather\\'d quiristers\\nApplied their wonted art, and with full joy\\nWelcom\\'d those hours of prime, and warbled shrill\\nAmid the leaves, that to their jocund lays\\ninept tenor; even as from branch to branch,\\nAlong the piney forests on the shore\\nOf Chiassi, rolls the gath\\'ring melody,\\nWhen Eolus hath from his cavern loos\\'d\\nThe dripping south.  Already had my steps,\\nThough slow, so far into that ancient wood\\nTransported me, I could not ken the place\\nWhere I had enter\\'d, when behold! my path\\nWas bounded by a rill, which to the left\\nWith little rippling waters bent the grass,\\nThat issued from its brink.  On earth no wave\\nHow clean soe\\'er, that would not seem to have\\nSome mixture in itself, compar\\'d with this,\\nTranspicuous, clear; yet darkly on it roll\\'d,\\nDarkly beneath perpetual gloom, which ne\\'er\\nAdmits or sun or moon light there to shine.\\n\\nMy feet advanc\\'d not; but my wond\\'ring eyes\\nPass\\'d onward, o\\'er the streamlet, to survey\\nThe tender May-bloom, flush\\'d through many a hue,\\nIn prodigal variety: and there,\\nAs object, rising suddenly to view,\\nThat from our bosom every thought beside\\nWith the rare marvel chases, I beheld\\nA lady all alone, who, singing, went,\\nAnd culling flower from flower, wherewith her way\\nWas all o\\'er painted.  \"Lady beautiful!\\nThou, who (if looks, that use to speak the heart,\\nAre worthy of our trust), with love\\'s own beam\\nDost warm thee,\" thus to her my speech I fram\\'d:\\n\"Ah! please thee hither towards the streamlet bend\\nThy steps so near, that I may list thy song.\\nBeholding thee and this fair place, methinks,\\nI call to mind where wander\\'d and how look\\'d\\nProserpine, in that season, when her child\\nThe mother lost, and she the bloomy spring.\"\\n\\nAs when a lady, turning in the dance,\\nDoth foot it featly, and advances scarce\\nOne step before the other to the ground;\\nOver the yellow and vermilion flowers\\nThus turn\\'d she at my suit, most maiden-like,\\nValing her sober eyes, and came so near,\\nThat I distinctly caught the dulcet sound.\\nArriving where the limped waters now\\nLav\\'d the green sward, her eyes she deign\\'d to raise,\\nThat shot such splendour on me, as I ween\\nNe\\'er glanced from Cytherea\\'s, when her son\\nHad sped his keenest weapon to her heart.\\nUpon the opposite bank she stood and smil\\'d\\nthrough her graceful fingers shifted still\\nThe intermingling dyes, which without seed\\nThat lofty land unbosoms.  By the stream\\nThree paces only were we sunder\\'d: yet\\nThe Hellespont, where Xerxes pass\\'d it o\\'er,\\n(A curb for ever to the pride of man)\\nWas by Leander not more hateful held\\nFor floating, with inhospitable wave\\n\\'Twixt Sestus and Abydos, than by me\\nThat flood, because it gave no passage thence.\\n\\n\"Strangers ye come, and haply in this place,\\nThat cradled human nature in its birth,\\nWond\\'ring, ye not without suspicion view\\nMy smiles: but that sweet strain of psalmody,\\n\\'Thou, Lord! hast made me glad,\\' will give ye light,\\nWhich may uncloud your minds.  And thou, who stand\\'st\\nThe foremost, and didst make thy suit to me,\\nSay if aught else thou wish to hear: for I\\nCame prompt to answer every doubt of thine.\"\\n\\nShe spake; and I replied: \"I know not how\\nTo reconcile this wave and rustling sound\\nOf forest leaves, with what I late have heard\\nOf opposite report.\"  She answering thus:\\n\"I will unfold the cause, whence that proceeds,\\nWhich makes thee wonder; and so purge the cloud\\nThat hath enwraps thee.  The First Good, whose joy\\nIs only in himself, created man\\nFor happiness, and gave this goodly place,\\nHis pledge and earnest of eternal peace.\\nFavour\\'d thus highly, through his own defect\\nHe fell, and here made short sojourn; he fell,\\nAnd, for the bitterness of sorrow, chang\\'d\\nLaughter unblam\\'d and ever-new delight.\\nThat vapours none, exhal\\'d from earth beneath,\\nOr from the waters (which, wherever heat\\nAttracts them, follow), might ascend thus far\\nTo vex man\\'s peaceful state, this mountain rose\\nSo high toward the heav\\'n, nor fears the rage\\nOf elements contending, from that part\\nExempted, where the gate his limit bars.\\nBecause the circumambient air throughout\\nWith its first impulse circles still, unless\\nAught interpose to cheek or thwart its course;\\nUpon the summit, which on every side\\nTo visitation of th\\' impassive air\\nIs open, doth that motion strike, and makes\\nBeneath its sway th\\' umbrageous wood resound:\\nAnd in the shaken plant such power resides,\\nThat it impregnates with its efficacy\\nThe voyaging breeze, upon whose subtle plume\\nThat wafted flies abroad; and th\\' other land\\nReceiving (as \\'t is worthy in itself,\\nOr in the clime, that warms it), doth conceive,\\nAnd from its womb produces many a tree\\nOf various virtue.  This when thou hast heard,\\nThe marvel ceases, if in yonder earth\\nSome plant without apparent seed be found\\nTo fix its fibrous stem.  And further learn,\\nThat with prolific foison of all seeds,\\nThis holy plain is fill\\'d, and in itself\\nBears fruit that ne\\'er was pluck\\'d on other soil.\\n\\n\"The water, thou behold\\'st, springs not from vein,\\nAs stream, that intermittently repairs\\nAnd spends his pulse of life, but issues forth\\nFrom fountain, solid, undecaying, sure;\\nAnd by the will omnific, full supply\\nFeeds whatsoe\\'er On either side it pours;\\nOn this devolv\\'d with power to take away\\nRemembrance of offence, on that to bring\\nRemembrance back of every good deed done.\\nFrom whence its name of Lethe on this part;\\nOn th\\' other Eunoe: both of which must first\\nBe tasted ere it work; the last exceeding\\nAll flavours else.  Albeit thy thirst may now\\nBe well contented, if I here break off,\\nNo more revealing: yet a corollary\\nI freely give beside: nor deem my words\\nLess grateful to thee, if they somewhat pass\\nThe stretch of promise.  They, whose verse of yore\\nThe golden age recorded and its bliss,\\nOn the Parnassian mountain, of this place\\nPerhaps had dream\\'d.  Here was man guiltless, here\\nPerpetual spring and every fruit, and this\\nThe far-fam\\'d nectar.\"  Turning to the bards,\\nWhen she had ceas\\'d, I noted in their looks\\nA smile at her conclusion; then my face\\nAgain directed to the lovely dame.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXIX\\n\\nSinging, as if enamour\\'d, she resum\\'d\\nAnd clos\\'d the song, with \"Blessed they whose sins\\nAre cover\\'d.\"  Like the wood-nymphs then, that tripp\\'d\\nSingly across the sylvan shadows, one\\nEager to view and one to \\'scape the sun,\\nSo mov\\'d she on, against the current, up\\nThe verdant rivage.  I, her mincing step\\nObserving, with as tardy step pursued.\\n\\nBetween us not an hundred paces trod,\\nThe bank, on each side bending equally,\\nGave me to face the orient.  Nor our way\\nFar onward brought us, when to me at once\\nShe turn\\'d, and cried: \"My brother! look and hearken.\"\\nAnd lo! a sudden lustre ran across\\nThrough the great forest on all parts, so bright\\nI doubted whether lightning were abroad;\\nBut that expiring ever in the spleen,\\nThat doth unfold it, and this during still\\nAnd waxing still in splendor, made me question\\nWhat it might be: and a sweet melody\\nRan through the luminous air.  Then did I chide\\nWith warrantable zeal the hardihood\\nOf our first parent, for that there were earth\\nStood in obedience to the heav\\'ns, she only,\\nWoman, the creature of an hour, endur\\'d not\\nRestraint of any veil: which had she borne\\nDevoutly, joys, ineffable as these,\\nHad from the first, and long time since, been mine.\\n\\nWhile through that wilderness of primy sweets\\nThat never fade, suspense I walk\\'d, and yet\\nExpectant of beatitude more high,\\nBefore us, like a blazing fire, the air\\nUnder the green boughs glow\\'d; and, for a song,\\nDistinct the sound of melody was heard.\\n\\nO ye thrice holy virgins! for your sakes\\nIf e\\'er I suffer\\'d hunger, cold and watching,\\nOccasion calls on me to crave your bounty.\\nNow through my breast let Helicon his stream\\nPour copious; and Urania with her choir\\nArise to aid me: while the verse unfolds\\nThings that do almost mock the grasp of thought.\\n\\nOnward a space, what seem\\'d seven trees of gold,\\nThe intervening distance to mine eye\\nFalsely presented; but when I was come\\nSo near them, that no lineament was lost\\nOf those, with which a doubtful object, seen\\nRemotely, plays on the misdeeming sense,\\nThen did the faculty, that ministers\\nDiscourse to reason, these for tapers of gold\\nDistinguish, and it th\\' singing trace the sound\\n\"Hosanna.\"  Above, their beauteous garniture\\nFlam\\'d with more ample lustre, than the moon\\nThrough cloudless sky at midnight in her full.\\n\\nI turn\\'d me full of wonder to my guide;\\nAnd he did answer with a countenance\\nCharg\\'d with no less amazement: whence my view\\nReverted to those lofty things, which came\\nSo slowly moving towards us, that the bride\\nWould have outstript them on her bridal day.\\n\\nThe lady called aloud: \"Why thus yet burns\\nAffection in thee for these living, lights,\\nAnd dost not look on that which follows them?\"\\n\\nI straightway mark\\'d a tribe behind them walk,\\nAs if attendant on their leaders, cloth\\'d\\nWith raiment of such whiteness, as on earth\\nWas never.  On my left, the wat\\'ry gleam\\nBorrow\\'d, and gave me back, when there I look\\'d.\\nAs in a mirror, my left side portray\\'d.\\n\\nWhen I had chosen on the river\\'s edge\\nSuch station, that the distance of the stream\\nAlone did separate me; there I stay\\'d\\nMy steps for clearer prospect, and beheld\\nThe flames go onward, leaving, as they went,\\nThe air behind them painted as with trail\\nOf liveliest pencils! so distinct were mark\\'d\\nAll those sev\\'n listed colours, whence the sun\\nMaketh his bow, and Cynthia her zone.\\nThese streaming gonfalons did flow beyond\\nMy vision; and ten paces, as I guess,\\nParted the outermost.  Beneath a sky\\nSo beautiful, came foul and-twenty elders,\\nBy two and two, with flower-de-luces crown\\'d.\\n\\nAll sang one song: \"Blessed be thou among\\nThe daughters of Adam! and thy loveliness\\nBlessed for ever!\"  After that the flowers,\\nAnd the fresh herblets, on the opposite brink,\\nWere free from that elected race; as light\\nIn heav\\'n doth second light, came after them\\nFour animals, each crown\\'d with verdurous leaf.\\nWith six wings each was plum\\'d, the plumage full\\nOf eyes, and th\\' eyes of Argus would be such,\\nWere they endued with life.  Reader, more rhymes\\nWill not waste in shadowing forth their form:\\nFor other need no straitens, that in this\\nI may not give my bounty room.  But read\\nEzekiel; for he paints them, from the north\\nHow he beheld them come by Chebar\\'s flood,\\nIn whirlwind, cloud and fire; and even such\\nAs thou shalt find them character\\'d by him,\\nHere were they; save as to the pennons; there,\\nFrom him departing, John accords with me.\\n\\nThe space, surrounded by the four, enclos\\'d\\nA car triumphal: on two wheels it came\\nDrawn at a Gryphon\\'s neck; and he above\\nStretch\\'d either wing uplifted, \\'tween the midst\\nAnd the three listed hues, on each side three;\\nSo that the wings did cleave or injure none;\\nAnd out of sight they rose.  The members, far\\nAs he was bird, were golden; white the rest\\nWith vermeil intervein\\'d.  So beautiful\\nA car in Rome ne\\'er grac\\'d Augustus pomp,\\nOr Africanus\\': e\\'en the sun\\'s itself\\nWere poor to this, that chariot of the sun\\nErroneous, which in blazing ruin fell\\nAt Tellus\\' pray\\'r devout, by the just doom\\nMysterious of all-seeing Jove.  Three nymphs\\nat the right wheel, came circling in smooth dance;\\nThe one so ruddy, that her form had scarce\\nBeen known within a furnace of clear flame:\\nThe next did look, as if the flesh and bones\\nWere emerald: snow new-fallen seem\\'d the third.\\n\\nNow seem\\'d the white to lead, the ruddy now;\\nAnd from her song who led, the others took\\nTheir treasure, swift or slow.  At th\\' other wheel,\\nA band quaternion, each in purple clad,\\nAdvanc\\'d with festal step, as of them one\\nThe rest conducted, one, upon whose front\\nThree eyes were seen.  In rear of all this group,\\nTwo old men I beheld, dissimilar\\nIn raiment, but in port and gesture like,\\nSolid and mainly grave; of whom the one\\nDid show himself some favour\\'d counsellor\\nOf the great Coan, him, whom nature made\\nTo serve the costliest creature of her tribe.\\nHis fellow mark\\'d an opposite intent,\\nBearing a sword, whose glitterance and keen edge,\\nE\\'en as I view\\'d it with the flood between,\\nAppall\\'d me.  Next four others I beheld,\\nOf humble seeming: and, behind them all,\\nOne single old man, sleeping, as he came,\\nWith a shrewd visage.  And these seven, each\\nLike the first troop were habited, but wore\\nNo braid of lilies on their temples wreath\\'d.\\nRather with roses and each vermeil flower,\\nA sight, but little distant, might have sworn,\\nThat they were all on fire above their brow.\\n\\nWhenas the car was o\\'er against me, straight.\\nWas heard a thund\\'ring, at whose voice it seem\\'d\\nThe chosen multitude were stay\\'d; for there,\\nWith the first ensigns, made they solemn halt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXX\\n\\nSoon as the polar light, which never knows\\nSetting nor rising, nor the shadowy veil\\nOf other cloud than sin, fair ornament\\nOf the first heav\\'n, to duty each one there\\nSafely convoying, as that lower doth\\nThe steersman to his port, stood firmly fix\\'d;\\nForthwith the saintly tribe, who in the van\\nBetween the Gryphon and its radiance came,\\nDid turn them to the car, as to their rest:\\nAnd one, as if commission\\'d from above,\\nIn holy chant thrice shorted forth aloud:\\n\"Come, spouse, from Libanus!\" and all the rest\\nTook up the song--At the last audit so\\nThe blest shall rise, from forth his cavern each\\nUplifting lightly his new-vested flesh,\\nAs, on the sacred litter, at the voice\\nAuthoritative of that elder, sprang\\nA hundred ministers and messengers\\nOf life eternal.  \"Blessed thou! who com\\'st!\"\\nAnd, \"O,\" they cried, \"from full hands scatter ye\\nUnwith\\'ring lilies;\" and, so saying, cast\\nFlowers over head and round them on all sides.\\n\\nI have beheld, ere now, at break of day,\\nThe eastern clime all roseate, and the sky\\nOppos\\'d, one deep and beautiful serene,\\nAnd the sun\\'s face so shaded, and with mists\\nAttemper\\'d at lids rising, that the eye\\nLong while endur\\'d the sight: thus in a cloud\\nOf flowers, that from those hands angelic rose,\\nAnd down, within and outside of the car,\\nFell showering, in white veil with olive wreath\\'d,\\nA virgin in my view appear\\'d, beneath\\nGreen mantle, rob\\'d in hue of living flame:\\n\\nAnd o\\'er my Spirit, that in former days\\nWithin her presence had abode so long,\\nNo shudd\\'ring terror crept.  Mine eyes no more\\nHad knowledge of her; yet there mov\\'d from her\\nA hidden virtue, at whose touch awak\\'d,\\nThe power of ancient love was strong within me.\\n\\nNo sooner on my vision streaming, smote\\nThe heav\\'nly influence, which years past, and e\\'en\\nIn childhood, thrill\\'d me, than towards Virgil I\\nTurn\\'d me to leftward, panting, like a babe,\\nThat flees for refuge to his mother\\'s breast,\\nIf aught have terrified or work\\'d him woe:\\nAnd would have cried: \"There is no dram of blood,\\nThat doth not quiver in me.  The old flame\\nThrows out clear tokens of reviving fire:\"\\nBut Virgil had bereav\\'d us of himself,\\nVirgil, my best-lov\\'d father; Virgil, he\\nTo whom I gave me up for safety: nor,\\nAll, our prime mother lost, avail\\'d to save\\nMy undew\\'d cheeks from blur of soiling tears.\\n\\n\"Dante, weep not, that Virgil leaves thee: nay,\\nWeep thou not yet: behooves thee feel the edge\\nOf other sword, and thou shalt weep for that.\"\\n\\nAs to the prow or stern, some admiral\\nPaces the deck, inspiriting his crew,\\nWhen \\'mid the sail-yards all hands ply aloof;\\nThus on the left side of the car I saw,\\n(Turning me at the sound of mine own name,\\nWhich here I am compell\\'d to register)\\nThe virgin station\\'d, who before appeared\\nVeil\\'d in that festive shower angelical.\\n\\nTowards me, across the stream, she bent her eyes;\\nThough from her brow the veil descending, bound\\nWith foliage of Minerva, suffer\\'d not\\nThat I beheld her clearly; then with act\\nFull royal, still insulting o\\'er her thrall,\\nAdded, as one, who speaking keepeth back\\nThe bitterest saying, to conclude the speech:\\n\"Observe me well.  I am, in sooth, I am\\nBeatrice.  What! and hast thou deign\\'d at last\\nApproach the mountainnewest not, O man!\\nThy happiness is whole?\"  Down fell mine eyes\\nOn the clear fount, but there, myself espying,\\nRecoil\\'d, and sought the greensward: such a weight\\nOf shame was on my forehead.  With a mien\\nOf that stern majesty, which doth surround\\nmother\\'s presence to her awe-struck child,\\nShe look\\'d; a flavour of such bitterness\\nWas mingled in her pity.  There her words\\nBrake off, and suddenly the angels sang:\\n\"In thee, O gracious Lord, my hope hath been:\"\\nBut went no farther than, \"Thou Lord, hast set\\nMy feet in ample room.\"  As snow, that lies\\nAmidst the living rafters on the back\\nOf Italy congeal\\'d when drifted high\\nAnd closely pil\\'d by rough Sclavonian blasts,\\nBreathe but the land whereon no shadow falls,\\nAnd straightway melting it distils away,\\nLike a fire-wasted taper: thus was I,\\nWithout a sigh or tear, or ever these\\nDid sing, that with the chiming of heav\\'n\\'s sphere,\\nStill in their warbling chime: but when the strain\\nOf dulcet symphony, express\\'d for me\\nTheir soft compassion, more than could the words\\n\"Virgin, why so consum\\'st him?\"  then the ice,\\nCongeal\\'d about my bosom, turn\\'d itself\\nTo spirit and water, and with anguish forth\\nGush\\'d through the lips and eyelids from the heart.\\n\\nUpon the chariot\\'s right edge still she stood,\\nImmovable, and thus address\\'d her words\\nTo those bright semblances with pity touch\\'d:\\n\"Ye in th\\' eternal day your vigils keep,\\nSo that nor night nor slumber, with close stealth,\\nConveys from you a single step in all\\nThe goings on of life: thence with more heed\\nI shape mine answer, for his ear intended,\\nWho there stands weeping, that the sorrow now\\nMay equal the transgression.  Not alone\\nThrough operation of the mighty orbs,\\nThat mark each seed to some predestin\\'d aim,\\nAs with aspect or fortunate or ill\\nThe constellations meet, but through benign\\nLargess of heav\\'nly graces, which rain down\\nFrom such a height, as mocks our vision, this man\\nWas in the freshness of his being, such,\\nSo gifted virtually, that in him\\nAll better habits wond\\'rously had thriv\\'d.\\nThe more of kindly strength is in the soil,\\nSo much doth evil seed and lack of culture\\nMar it the more, and make it run to wildness.\\nThese looks sometime upheld him; for I show\\'d\\nMy youthful eyes, and led him by their light\\nIn upright walking.  Soon as I had reach\\'d\\nThe threshold of my second age, and chang\\'d\\nMy mortal for immortal, then he left me,\\nAnd gave himself to others.  When from flesh\\nTo spirit I had risen, and increase\\nOf beauty and of virtue circled me,\\nI was less dear to him, and valued less.\\nHis steps were turn\\'d into deceitful ways,\\nFollowing false images of good, that make\\nNo promise perfect.  Nor avail\\'d me aught\\nTo sue for inspirations, with the which,\\nI, both in dreams of night, and otherwise,\\nDid call him back; of them so little reck\\'d him,\\nSuch depth he fell, that all device was short\\nOf his preserving, save that he should view\\nThe children of perdition.  To this end\\nI visited the purlieus of the dead:\\nAnd one, who hath conducted him thus high,\\nReceiv\\'d my supplications urg\\'d with weeping.\\nIt were a breaking of God\\'s high decree,\\nIf Lethe should be past, and such food tasted\\nWithout the cost of some repentant tear.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXXI\\n\\n\"O Thou!\"  her words she thus without delay\\nResuming, turn\\'d their point on me, to whom\\nThey but with lateral edge seem\\'d harsh before,\\n\"Say thou, who stand\\'st beyond the holy stream,\\nIf this be true.  A charge so grievous needs\\nThine own avowal.\"  On my faculty\\nSuch strange amazement hung, the voice expir\\'d\\nImperfect, ere its organs gave it birth.\\n\\nA little space refraining, then she spake:\\n\"What dost thou muse on?  Answer me.  The wave\\nOn thy remembrances of evil yet\\nHath done no injury.\"  A mingled sense\\nOf fear and of confusion, from my lips\\nDid such a \"Yea\" produce, as needed help\\nOf vision to interpret.  As when breaks\\nIn act to be discharg\\'d, a cross-bow bent\\nBeyond its pitch, both nerve and bow o\\'erstretch\\'d,\\nThe flagging weapon feebly hits the mark;\\nThus, tears and sighs forth gushing, did I burst\\nBeneath the heavy load, and thus my voice\\nWas slacken\\'d on its way.  She straight began:\\n\"When my desire invited thee to love\\nThe good, which sets a bound to our aspirings,\\nWhat bar of thwarting foss or linked chain\\nDid meet thee, that thou so should\\'st quit the hope\\nOf further progress, or what bait of ease\\nOr promise of allurement led thee on\\nElsewhere, that thou elsewhere should\\'st rather wait?\"\\n\\nA bitter sigh I drew, then scarce found voice\\nTo answer, hardly to these sounds my lips\\nGave utterance, wailing: \"Thy fair looks withdrawn,\\nThings present, with deceitful pleasures, turn\\'d\\nMy steps aside.\"  She answering spake: \"Hadst thou\\nBeen silent, or denied what thou avow\\'st,\\nThou hadst not hid thy sin the more: such eye\\nObserves it.  But whene\\'er the sinner\\'s cheek\\nBreaks forth into the precious-streaming tears\\nOf self-accusing, in our court the wheel\\nOf justice doth run counter to the edge.\\nHowe\\'er that thou may\\'st profit by thy shame\\nFor errors past, and that henceforth more strength\\nMay arm thee, when thou hear\\'st the Siren-voice,\\nLay thou aside the motive to this grief,\\nAnd lend attentive ear, while I unfold\\nHow opposite a way my buried flesh\\nShould have impell\\'d thee.  Never didst thou spy\\nIn art or nature aught so passing sweet,\\nAs were the limbs, that in their beauteous frame\\nEnclos\\'d me, and are scatter\\'d now in dust.\\nIf sweetest thing thus fail\\'d thee with my death,\\nWhat, afterward, of mortal should thy wish\\nHave tempted?  When thou first hadst felt the dart\\nOf perishable things, in my departing\\nFor better realms, thy wing thou should\\'st have prun\\'d\\nTo follow me, and never stoop\\'d again\\nTo \\'bide a second blow for a slight girl,\\nOr other gaud as transient and as vain.\\nThe new and inexperienc\\'d bird awaits,\\nTwice it may be, or thrice, the fowler\\'s aim;\\nBut in the sight of one, whose plumes are full,\\nIn vain the net is spread, the arrow wing\\'d.\"\\n\\nI stood, as children silent and asham\\'d\\nStand, list\\'ning, with their eyes upon the earth,\\nAcknowledging their fault and self-condemn\\'d.\\nAnd she resum\\'d: \"If, but to hear thus pains thee,\\nRaise thou thy beard, and lo! what sight shall do!\"\\n\\nWith less reluctance yields a sturdy holm,\\nRent from its fibers by a blast, that blows\\nFrom off the pole, or from Iarbas\\' land,\\nThan I at her behest my visage rais\\'d:\\nAnd thus the face denoting by the beard,\\nI mark\\'d the secret sting her words convey\\'d.\\n\\nNo sooner lifted I mine aspect up,\\nThan downward sunk that vision I beheld\\nOf goodly creatures vanish; and mine eyes\\nYet unassur\\'d and wavering, bent their light\\nOn Beatrice.  Towards the animal,\\nWho joins two natures in one form, she turn\\'d,\\nAnd, even under shadow of her veil,\\nAnd parted by the verdant rill, that flow\\'d\\nBetween, in loveliness appear\\'d as much\\nHer former self surpassing, as on earth\\nAll others she surpass\\'d.  Remorseful goads\\nShot sudden through me.  Each thing else, the more\\nIts love had late beguil\\'d me, now the more\\nI Was loathsome.  On my heart so keenly smote\\nThe bitter consciousness, that on the ground\\nO\\'erpower\\'d I fell: and what my state was then,\\nShe knows who was the cause.  When now my strength\\nFlow\\'d back, returning outward from the heart,\\nThe lady, whom alone I first had seen,\\nI found above me.  \"Loose me not,\" she cried:\\n\"Loose not thy hold;\" and lo! had dragg\\'d me high\\nAs to my neck into the stream, while she,\\nStill as she drew me after, swept along,\\nSwift as a shuttle, bounding o\\'er the wave.\\n\\nThe blessed shore approaching then was heard\\nSo sweetly, \"Tu asperges me,\" that I\\nMay not remember, much less tell the sound.\\nThe beauteous dame, her arms expanding, clasp\\'d\\nMy temples, and immerg\\'d me, where \\'t was fit\\nThe wave should drench me: and thence raising up,\\nWithin the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs\\nPresented me so lav\\'d, and with their arm\\nThey each did cover me.  \"Here are we nymphs,\\nAnd in the heav\\'n are stars.  Or ever earth\\nWas visited of Beatrice, we\\nAppointed for her handmaids, tended on her.\\nWe to her eyes will lead thee; but the light\\nOf gladness that is in them, well to scan,\\nThose yonder three, of deeper ken than ours,\\nThy sight shall quicken.\"  Thus began their song;\\nAnd then they led me to the Gryphon\\'s breast,\\nWhile, turn\\'d toward us, Beatrice stood.\\n\"Spare not thy vision.  We have stationed thee\\nBefore the emeralds, whence love erewhile\\nHath drawn his weapons on thee.\"  As they spake,\\nA thousand fervent wishes riveted\\nMine eyes upon her beaming eyes, that stood\\nStill fix\\'d toward the Gryphon motionless.\\nAs the sun strikes a mirror, even thus\\nWithin those orbs the twofold being, shone,\\nFor ever varying, in one figure now\\nReflected, now in other.  Reader! muse\\nHow wond\\'rous in my sight it seem\\'d to mark\\nA thing, albeit steadfast in itself,\\nYet in its imag\\'d semblance mutable.\\n\\nFull of amaze, and joyous, while my soul\\nFed on the viand, whereof still desire\\nGrows with satiety, the other three\\nWith gesture, that declar\\'d a loftier line,\\nAdvanc\\'d: to their own carol on they came\\nDancing in festive ring angelical.\\n\\n\"Turn, Beatrice!\" was their song: \"O turn\\nThy saintly sight on this thy faithful one,\\nWho to behold thee many a wearisome pace\\nHath measur\\'d.  Gracious at our pray\\'r vouchsafe\\nUnveil to him thy cheeks: that he may mark\\nThy second beauty, now conceal\\'d.\"  O splendour!\\nO sacred light eternal! who is he\\nSo pale with musing in Pierian shades,\\nOr with that fount so lavishly imbued,\\nWhose spirit should not fail him in th\\' essay\\nTo represent thee such as thou didst seem,\\nWhen under cope of the still-chiming heaven\\nThou gav\\'st to open air thy charms reveal\\'d.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXXII\\n\\nMine eyes with such an eager coveting,\\nWere bent to rid them of their ten years\\' thirst,\\nNo other sense was waking: and e\\'en they\\nWere fenc\\'d on either side from heed of aught;\\nSo tangled in its custom\\'d toils that smile\\nOf saintly brightness drew me to itself,\\nWhen forcibly toward the left my sight\\nThe sacred virgins turn\\'d; for from their lips\\nI heard the warning sounds: \"Too fix\\'d a gaze!\"\\n\\nAwhile my vision labor\\'d; as when late\\nUpon the\\' o\\'erstrained eyes the sun hath smote:\\nBut soon to lesser object, as the view\\nWas now recover\\'d (lesser in respect\\nTo that excess of sensible, whence late\\nI had perforce been sunder\\'d) on their right\\nI mark\\'d that glorious army wheel, and turn,\\nAgainst the sun and sev\\'nfold lights, their front.\\nAs when, their bucklers for protection rais\\'d,\\nA well-rang\\'d troop, with portly banners curl\\'d,\\nWheel circling, ere the whole can change their ground:\\nE\\'en thus the goodly regiment of heav\\'n\\nProceeding, all did pass us, ere the car\\nHad slop\\'d his beam.  Attendant at the wheels\\nThe damsels turn\\'d; and on the Gryphon mov\\'d\\nThe sacred burden, with a pace so smooth,\\nNo feather on him trembled.  The fair dame\\nWho through the wave had drawn me, companied\\nBy Statius and myself, pursued the wheel,\\nWhose orbit, rolling, mark\\'d a lesser arch.\\n\\nThrough the high wood, now void (the more her blame,\\nWho by the serpent was beguil\\'d) I past\\nWith step in cadence to the harmony\\nAngelic.  Onward had we mov\\'d, as far\\nPerchance as arrow at three several flights\\nFull wing\\'d had sped, when from her station down\\nDescended Beatrice.  With one voice\\nAll murmur\\'d  \"Adam,\" circling next a plant\\nDespoil\\'d of flowers and leaf on every bough.\\nIts tresses, spreading more as more they rose,\\nWere such, as \\'midst their forest wilds for height\\nThe Indians might have gaz\\'d at.  \"Blessed thou!\\nGryphon, whose beak hath never pluck\\'d that tree\\nPleasant to taste: for hence the appetite\\nWas warp\\'d to evil.\"  Round the stately trunk\\nThus shouted forth the rest, to whom return\\'d\\nThe animal twice-gender\\'d: \"Yea: for so\\nThe generation of the just are sav\\'d.\"\\nAnd turning to the chariot-pole, to foot\\nHe drew it of the widow\\'d branch, and bound\\nThere left unto the stock whereon it grew.\\n\\nAs when large floods of radiance from above\\nStream, with that radiance mingled, which ascends\\nNext after setting of the scaly sign,\\nOur plants then burgeon, and each wears anew\\nHis wonted colours, ere the sun have yok\\'d\\nBeneath another star his flamy steeds;\\nThus putting forth a hue, more faint than rose,\\nAnd deeper than the violet, was renew\\'d\\nThe plant, erewhile in all its branches bare.\\n\\nUnearthly was the hymn, which then arose.\\nI understood it not, nor to the end\\nEndur\\'d the harmony.  Had I the skill\\nTo pencil forth, how clos\\'d th\\' unpitying eyes\\nSlumb\\'ring, when Syrinx warbled, (eyes that paid\\nSo dearly for their watching,) then like painter,\\nThat with a model paints, I might design\\nThe manner of my falling into sleep.\\nBut feign who will the slumber cunningly;\\nI pass it by to when I wak\\'d, and tell\\nHow suddenly a flash of splendour rent\\nThe curtain of my sleep, and one cries out:\\n\"Arise, what dost thou?\"  As the chosen three,\\nOn Tabor\\'s mount, admitted to behold\\nThe blossoming of that fair tree, whose fruit\\nIs coveted of angels, and doth make\\nPerpetual feast in heaven, to themselves\\nReturning at the word, whence deeper sleeps\\nWere broken, that they their tribe diminish\\'d saw,\\nBoth Moses and Elias gone, and chang\\'d\\nThe stole their master wore: thus to myself\\nReturning, over me beheld I stand\\nThe piteous one, who cross the stream had brought\\nMy steps.  \"And where,\" all doubting, I exclaim\\'d,\\n\"Is Beatrice?\"--\"See her,\" she replied,\\n\"Beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root.\\nBehold th\\' associate choir that circles her.\\nThe others, with a melody more sweet\\nAnd more profound, journeying to higher realms,\\nUpon the Gryphon tend.\"  If there her words\\nWere clos\\'d, I know not; but mine eyes had now\\nTa\\'en view of her, by whom all other thoughts\\nWere barr\\'d admittance.  On the very ground\\nAlone she sat, as she had there been left\\nA guard upon the wain, which I beheld\\nBound to the twyform beast.  The seven nymphs\\nDid make themselves a cloister round about her,\\nAnd in their hands upheld those lights secure\\nFrom blast septentrion and the gusty south.\\n\\n\"A little while thou shalt be forester here:\\nAnd citizen shalt be forever with me,\\nOf that true Rome, wherein Christ dwells a Roman\\nTo profit the misguided world, keep now\\nThine eyes upon the car; and what thou seest,\\nTake heed thou write, returning to that place.\"\\n\\nThus Beatrice: at whose feet inclin\\'d\\nDevout, at her behest, my thought and eyes,\\nI, as she bade, directed.  Never fire,\\nWith so swift motion, forth a stormy cloud\\nLeap\\'d downward from the welkin\\'s farthest bound,\\nAs I beheld the bird of Jove descending\\nPounce on the tree, and, as he rush\\'d, the rind,\\nDisparting crush beneath him, buds much more\\nAnd leaflets.  On the car with all his might\\nHe struck, whence, staggering like a ship, it reel\\'d,\\nAt random driv\\'n, to starboard now, o\\'ercome,\\nAnd now to larboard, by the vaulting waves.\\n\\nNext springing up into the chariot\\'s womb\\nA fox I saw, with hunger seeming pin\\'d\\nOf all good food.  But, for his ugly sins\\nThe saintly maid rebuking him, away\\nScamp\\'ring he turn\\'d, fast as his hide-bound corpse\\nWould bear him.  Next, from whence before he came,\\nI saw the eagle dart into the hull\\nO\\' th\\' car, and leave it with his feathers lin\\'d;\\nAnd then a voice, like that which issues forth\\nFrom heart with sorrow riv\\'d, did issue forth\\nFrom heav\\'n, and, \"O poor bark of mine!\" it cried,\\n\"How badly art thou freighted!\"  Then, it seem\\'d,\\nThat the earth open\\'d between either wheel,\\nAnd I beheld a dragon issue thence,\\nThat through the chariot fix\\'d his forked train;\\nAnd like a wasp that draggeth back the sting,\\nSo drawing forth his baleful train, he dragg\\'d\\nPart of the bottom forth, and went his way\\nExulting.  What remain\\'d, as lively turf\\nWith green herb, so did clothe itself with plumes,\\nWhich haply had with purpose chaste and kind\\nBeen offer\\'d; and therewith were cloth\\'d the wheels,\\nBoth one and other, and the beam, so quickly\\nA sigh were not breath\\'d sooner.  Thus transform\\'d,\\nThe holy structure, through its several parts,\\nDid put forth heads, three on the beam, and one\\nOn every side; the first like oxen horn\\'d,\\nBut with a single horn upon their front\\nThe four.  Like monster sight hath never seen.\\nO\\'er it methought there sat, secure as rock\\nOn mountain\\'s lofty top, a shameless whore,\\nWhose ken rov\\'d loosely round her.  At her side,\\nAs \\'t were that none might bear her off, I saw\\nA giant stand; and ever, and anon\\nThey mingled kisses.  But, her lustful eyes\\nChancing on me to wander, that fell minion\\nScourg\\'d her from head to foot all o\\'er; then full\\nOf jealousy, and fierce with rage, unloos\\'d\\nThe monster, and dragg\\'d on, so far across\\nThe forest, that from me its shades alone\\nShielded the harlot and the new-form\\'d brute.\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXXIII\\n\\n\"The heathen, Lord! are come!\" responsive thus,\\nThe trinal now, and now the virgin band\\nQuaternion, their sweet psalmody began,\\nWeeping; and Beatrice listen\\'d, sad\\nAnd sighing, to the song\\', in such a mood,\\nThat Mary, as she stood beside the cross,\\nWas scarce more chang\\'d.  But when they gave her place\\nTo speak, then, risen upright on her feet,\\nShe, with a colour glowing bright as fire,\\nDid answer: \"Yet a little while, and ye\\nShall see me not; and, my beloved sisters,\\nAgain a little while, and ye shall see me.\"\\n\\nBefore her then she marshall\\'d all the seven,\\nAnd, beck\\'ning only motion\\'d me, the dame,\\nAnd that remaining sage, to follow her.\\n\\nSo on she pass\\'d; and had not set, I ween,\\nHer tenth step to the ground, when with mine eyes\\nHer eyes encounter\\'d; and, with visage mild,\\n\"So mend thy pace,\" she cried, \"that if my words\\nAddress thee, thou mayst still be aptly plac\\'d\\nTo hear them.\"  Soon as duly to her side\\nI now had hasten\\'d: \"Brother!\" she began,\\n\"Why mak\\'st thou no attempt at questioning,\\nAs thus we walk together?\"  Like to those\\nWho, speaking with too reverent an awe\\nBefore their betters, draw not forth the voice\\nAlive unto their lips, befell me shell\\nThat I in sounds imperfect thus began:\\n\"Lady! what I have need of, that thou know\\'st,\\nAnd what will suit my need.\"  She answering thus:\\n\"Of fearfulness and shame, I will, that thou\\nHenceforth do rid thee: that thou speak no more,\\nAs one who dreams.  Thus far be taught of me:\\nThe vessel, which thou saw\\'st the serpent break,\\nWas and is not: let him, who hath the blame,\\nHope not to scare God\\'s vengeance with a sop.\\nWithout an heir for ever shall not be\\nThat eagle, he, who left the chariot plum\\'d,\\nWhich monster made it first and next a prey.\\nPlainly I view, and therefore speak, the stars\\nE\\'en now approaching, whose conjunction, free\\nFrom all impediment and bar, brings on\\nA season, in the which, one sent from God,\\n(Five hundred, five, and ten, do mark him out)\\nThat foul one, and th\\' accomplice of her guilt,\\nThe giant, both shall slay.  And if perchance\\nMy saying, dark as Themis or as Sphinx,\\nFail to persuade thee, (since like them it foils\\nThe intellect with blindness) yet ere long\\nEvents shall be the Naiads, that will solve\\nThis knotty riddle, and no damage light\\nOn flock or field.  Take heed; and as these words\\nBy me are utter\\'d, teach them even so\\nTo those who live that life, which is a race\\nTo death: and when thou writ\\'st them, keep in mind\\nNot to conceal how thou hast seen the plant,\\nThat twice hath now been spoil\\'d.

H. F. CARY, M.A.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCantos 1 - 34\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO I\\n\\n\\nIn the midway of this our mortal life,\\nI found me in a gloomy wood, astray\\nGone from the path direct: and e\\'en to tell\\nIt were no easy task, how savage wild\\nThat forest, how robust and rough its growth,\\nWhich to remember only, my dismay\\nRenews, in bitterness not far from death.\\nYet to discourse of what there good befell,\\nAll else will I relate discover\\'d there.\\nHow first I enter\\'d it I scarce can say,\\nSuch sleepy dullness in that instant weigh\\'d\\nMy senses down, when the true path I left,\\nBut when a mountain\\'s foot I reach\\'d, where clos\\'d\\nThe valley, that had pierc\\'d my heart with dread,\\nI look\\'d aloft, and saw his shoulders broad\\nAlready vested with that planet\\'s beam,\\nWho leads all wanderers safe through every way.\\n\\nThen was a little respite to the fear,\\nThat in my heart\\'s recesses deep had lain,\\nAll of that night, so pitifully pass\\'d:\\nAnd as a man, with difficult short breath,\\nForespent with toiling, \\'scap\\'d from sea to shore,\\nTurns to the perilous wide waste, and stands\\nAt gaze; e\\'en so my spirit, that yet fail\\'d\\nStruggling with terror, turn\\'d to view the straits,\\nThat none hath pass\\'d and liv\\'d.  My weary frame\\nAfter short pause recomforted, again\\nI journey\\'d on over that lonely steep,\\n\\nThe hinder foot still firmer.  Scarce the ascent\\nBegan, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,\\nAnd cover\\'d with a speckled skin, appear\\'d,\\nNor, when it saw me, vanish\\'d, rather strove\\nTo check my onward going; that ofttimes\\nWith purpose to retrace my steps I turn\\'d.\\n\\nThe hour was morning\\'s prime, and on his way\\nAloft the sun ascended with those stars,\\nThat with him rose, when Love divine first mov\\'d\\nThose its fair works: so that with joyous hope\\nAll things conspir\\'d to fill me, the gay skin\\nOf that swift animal, the matin dawn\\nAnd the sweet season.  Soon that joy was chas\\'d,\\nAnd by new dread succeeded, when in view\\nA lion came, \\'gainst me, as it appear\\'d,\\n\\nWith his head held aloft and hunger-mad,\\nThat e\\'en the air was fear-struck.  A she-wolf\\nWas at his heels, who in her leanness seem\\'d\\nFull of all wants, and many a land hath made\\nDisconsolate ere now.  She with such fear\\nO\\'erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall\\'d,\\nThat of the height all hope I lost.  As one,\\nWho with his gain elated, sees the time\\nWhen all unwares is gone, he inwardly\\nMourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,\\nHaunted by that fell beast, never at peace,\\nWho coming o\\'er against me, by degrees\\nImpell\\'d me where the sun in silence rests.\\n\\nWhile to the lower space with backward step\\nI fell, my ken discern\\'d the form one of one,\\nWhose voice seem\\'d faint through long disuse of speech.\\nWhen him in that great desert I espied,\\n\"Have mercy on me!\" cried I out aloud,\\n\"Spirit! or living man! what e\\'er thou be!\"\\n\\nHe answer\\'d: \"Now not man, man once I was,\\nAnd born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both\\nBy country, when the power of Julius yet\\nWas scarcely firm.  At Rome my life was past\\nBeneath the mild Augustus, in the time\\nOf fabled deities and false.  A bard\\nWas I, and made Anchises\\' upright son\\nThe subject of my song, who came from Troy,\\nWhen the flames prey\\'d on Ilium\\'s haughty towers.\\nBut thou, say wherefore to such perils past\\nReturn\\'st thou?  wherefore not this pleasant mount\\nAscendest, cause and source of all delight?\"\\n\"And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,\\nFrom which such copious floods of eloquence\\nHave issued?\"  I with front abash\\'d replied.\\n\"Glory and light of all the tuneful train!\\nMay it avail me that I long with zeal\\nHave sought thy volume, and with love immense\\nHave conn\\'d it o\\'er.  My master thou and guide!\\nThou he from whom alone I have deriv\\'d\\nThat style, which for its beauty into fame\\nExalts me.  See the beast, from whom I fled.\\nO save me from her, thou illustrious sage!\"\\n\\n\"For every vein and pulse throughout my frame\\nShe hath made tremble.\"  He, soon as he saw\\nThat I was weeping, answer\\'d, \"Thou must needs\\nAnother way pursue, if thou wouldst \\'scape\\nFrom out that savage wilderness.  This beast,\\nAt whom thou criest, her way will suffer none\\nTo pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:\\nSo bad and so accursed in her kind,\\nThat never sated is her ravenous will,\\nStill after food more craving than before.\\nTo many an animal in wedlock vile\\nShe fastens, and shall yet to many more,\\nUntil that greyhound come, who shall destroy\\nHer with sharp pain.  He will not life support\\nBy earth nor its base metals, but by love,\\nWisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be\\nThe land \\'twixt either Feltro.  In his might\\nShall safety to Italia\\'s plains arise,\\nFor whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,\\nNisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.\\nHe with incessant chase through every town\\nShall worry, until he to hell at length\\nRestore her, thence by envy first let loose.\\nI for thy profit pond\\'ring now devise,\\nThat thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide\\nWill lead thee hence through an eternal space,\\nWhere thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see\\nSpirits of old tormented, who invoke\\nA second death; and those next view, who dwell\\nContent in fire, for that they hope to come,\\nWhene\\'er the time may be, among the blest,\\nInto whose regions if thou then desire\\nT\\' ascend, a spirit worthier then I\\nMust lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,\\nThou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,\\nWho reigns above, a rebel to his law,\\nAdjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,\\nThat to his city none through me should come.\\nHe in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds\\nHis citadel and throne.  O happy those,\\nWhom there he chooses!\"  I to him in few:\\n\"Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,\\nI do beseech thee (that this ill and worse\\nI may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,\\nThat I Saint Peter\\'s gate may view, and those\\nWho as thou tell\\'st, are in such dismal plight.\"\\n\\nOnward he mov\\'d, I close his steps pursu\\'d.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO II\\n\\nNOW was the day departing, and the air,\\nImbrown\\'d with shadows, from their toils releas\\'d\\nAll animals on earth; and I alone\\nPrepar\\'d myself the conflict to sustain,\\nBoth of sad pity, and that perilous road,\\nWhich my unerring memory shall retrace.\\n\\nO Muses!  O high genius! now vouchsafe\\nYour aid!  O mind! that all I saw hast kept\\nSafe in a written record, here thy worth\\nAnd eminent endowments come to proof.\\n\\nI thus began: \"Bard! thou who art my guide,\\nConsider well, if virtue be in me\\nSufficient, ere to this high enterprise\\nThou trust me.  Thou hast told that Silvius\\' sire,\\nYet cloth\\'d in corruptible flesh, among\\nTh\\' immortal tribes had entrance, and was there\\nSensible present.  Yet if heaven\\'s great Lord,\\nAlmighty foe to ill, such favour shew\\'d,\\nIn contemplation of the high effect,\\nBoth what and who from him should issue forth,\\nIt seems in reason\\'s judgment well deserv\\'d:\\nSith he of Rome, and of Rome\\'s empire wide,\\nIn heaven\\'s empyreal height was chosen sire:\\nBoth which, if truth be spoken, were ordain\\'d\\nAnd \\'stablish\\'d for the holy place, where sits\\nWho to great Peter\\'s sacred chair succeeds.\\nHe from this journey, in thy song renown\\'d,\\nLearn\\'d things, that to his victory gave rise\\nAnd to the papal robe.  In after-times\\nThe chosen vessel also travel\\'d there,\\nTo bring us back assurance in that faith,\\nWhich is the entrance to salvation\\'s way.\\nBut I, why should I there presume?  or who\\nPermits it?  not, Aeneas I nor Paul.\\nMyself I deem not worthy, and none else\\nWill deem me.  I, if on this voyage then\\nI venture, fear it will in folly end.\\nThou, who art wise, better my meaning know\\'st,\\nThan I can speak.\"  As one, who unresolves\\nWhat he hath late resolv\\'d, and with new thoughts\\nChanges his purpose, from his first intent\\nRemov\\'d; e\\'en such was I on that dun coast,\\nWasting in thought my enterprise, at first\\nSo eagerly embrac\\'d.  \"If right thy words\\nI scan,\" replied that shade magnanimous,\\n\"Thy soul is by vile fear assail\\'d, which oft\\nSo overcasts a man, that he recoils\\nFrom noblest resolution, like a beast\\nAt some false semblance in the twilight gloom.\\nThat from this terror thou mayst free thyself,\\nI will instruct thee why I came, and what\\nI heard in that same instant, when for thee\\nGrief touch\\'d me first.  I was among the tribe,\\nWho rest suspended, when a dame, so blest\\nAnd lovely, I besought her to command,\\nCall\\'d me; her eyes were brighter than the star\\nOf day; and she with gentle voice and soft\\nAngelically tun\\'d her speech address\\'d:\\n\"O courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame\\nYet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!\\nA friend, not of my fortune but myself,\\nOn the wide desert in his road has met\\nHindrance so great, that he through fear has turn\\'d.\\nNow much I dread lest he past help have stray\\'d,\\nAnd I be ris\\'n too late for his relief,\\nFrom what in heaven of him I heard.  Speed now,\\nAnd by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,\\nAnd by all means for his deliverance meet,\\nAssist him.  So to me will comfort spring.\\nI who now bid thee on this errand forth\\nAm Beatrice; from a place I come\\n\\n(Note: Beatrice.  I use this word, as it is\\npronounced in the Italian, as consisting of four\\nsyllables, of which the third is a long one.)\\n\\nRevisited with joy.  Love brought me thence,\\nWho prompts my speech.  When in my Master\\'s sight\\nI stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell.\"\\n\\nShe then was silent, and I thus began:\\n\"O Lady! by whose influence alone,\\nMankind excels whatever is contain\\'d\\nWithin that heaven which hath the smallest orb,\\nSo thy command delights me, that to obey,\\nIf it were done already, would seem late.\\nNo need hast thou farther to speak thy will;\\nYet tell the reason, why thou art not loth\\nTo leave that ample space, where to return\\nThou burnest, for this centre here beneath.\"\\n\\nShe then: \"Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire,\\nI will instruct thee briefly, why no dread\\nHinders my entrance here.  Those things alone\\nAre to be fear\\'d, whence evil may proceed,\\nNone else, for none are terrible beside.\\nI am so fram\\'d by God, thanks to his grace!\\nThat any suff\\'rance of your misery\\nTouches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire\\nAssails me.  In high heaven a blessed dame\\nBesides, who mourns with such effectual grief\\nThat hindrance, which I send thee to remove,\\nThat God\\'s stern judgment to her will inclines.\"\\nTo Lucia calling, her she thus bespake:\\n\"Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid\\nAnd I commend him to thee.\"  At her word\\nSped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe,\\nAnd coming to the place, where I abode\\nSeated with Rachel, her of ancient days,\\nShe thus address\\'d me: \"Thou true praise of God!\\nBeatrice! why is not thy succour lent\\nTo him, who so much lov\\'d thee, as to leave\\nFor thy sake all the multitude admires?\\nDost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,\\nNor mark the death, which in the torrent flood,\\nSwoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?\"\\n\"Ne\\'er among men did any with such speed\\nHaste to their profit, flee from their annoy,\\nAs when these words were spoken, I came here,\\nDown from my blessed seat, trusting the force\\nOf thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all\\nWho well have mark\\'d it, into honour brings.\"\\n\\n\"When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes\\nTearful she turn\\'d aside; whereat I felt\\nRedoubled zeal to serve thee.  As she will\\'d,\\nThus am I come: I sav\\'d thee from the beast,\\nWho thy near way across the goodly mount\\nPrevented.  What is this comes o\\'er thee then?\\nWhy, why dost thou hang back?  why in thy breast\\nHarbour vile fear?  why hast not courage there\\nAnd noble daring?  Since three maids so blest\\nThy safety plan, e\\'en in the court of heaven;\\nAnd so much certain good my words forebode.\"\\n\\nAs florets, by the frosty air of night\\nBent down and clos\\'d, when day has blanch\\'d their leaves,\\nRise all unfolded on their spiry stems;\\nSo was my fainting vigour new restor\\'d,\\nAnd to my heart such kindly courage ran,\\nThat I as one undaunted soon replied:\\n\"O full of pity she, who undertook\\nMy succour! and thou kind who didst perform\\nSo soon her true behest!  With such desire\\nThou hast dispos\\'d me to renew my voyage,\\nThat my first purpose fully is resum\\'d.\\nLead on: one only will is in us both.\\nThou art my guide, my master thou, and lord.\"\\n\\nSo spake I; and when he had onward mov\\'d,\\nI enter\\'d on the deep and woody way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO III\\n\\n\"THROUGH me you pass into the city of woe:\\nThrough me you pass into eternal pain:\\nThrough me among the people lost for aye.\\nJustice the founder of my fabric mov\\'d:\\nTo rear me was the task of power divine,\\nSupremest wisdom, and primeval love.\\nBefore me things create were none, save things\\nEternal, and eternal I endure.\\n\\n\"All hope abandon ye who enter here.\"\\n\\nSuch characters in colour dim I mark\\'d\\nOver a portal\\'s lofty arch inscrib\\'d:\\nWhereat I thus: \"Master, these words import\\nHard meaning.\"  He as one prepar\\'d replied:\\n\"Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave;\\nHere be vile fear extinguish\\'d. We are come\\nWhere I have told thee we shall see the souls\\nTo misery doom\\'d, who intellectual good\\nHave lost.\"  And when his hand he had stretch\\'d forth\\nTo mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer\\'d,\\nInto that secret place he led me on.\\n\\nHere sighs with lamentations and loud moans\\nResounded through the air pierc\\'d by no star,\\nThat e\\'en I wept at entering.  Various tongues,\\nHorrible languages, outcries of woe,\\nAccents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,\\nWith hands together smote that swell\\'d the sounds,\\nMade up a tumult, that for ever whirls\\nRound through that air with solid darkness stain\\'d,\\nLike to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.\\n\\nI then, with error yet encompass\\'d, cried:\\n\"O master!  What is this I hear?  What race\\nAre these, who seem so overcome with woe?\"\\n\\nHe thus to me: \"This miserable fate\\nSuffer the wretched souls of those, who liv\\'d\\nWithout or praise or blame, with that ill band\\nOf angels mix\\'d, who nor rebellious prov\\'d\\nNor yet were true to God, but for themselves\\nWere only.  From his bounds Heaven drove them forth,\\nNot to impair his lustre, nor the depth\\nOf Hell receives them, lest th\\' accursed tribe\\nShould glory thence with exultation vain.\"\\n\\nI then: \"Master! what doth aggrieve them thus,\\nThat they lament so loud?\"  He straight replied:\\n\"That will I tell thee briefly.  These of death\\nNo hope may entertain: and their blind life\\nSo meanly passes, that all other lots\\nThey envy.  Fame of them the world hath none,\\nNor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both.\\nSpeak not of them, but look, and pass them by.\"\\n\\nAnd I, who straightway look\\'d, beheld a flag,\\nWhich whirling ran around so rapidly,\\nThat it no pause obtain\\'d: and following came\\nSuch a long train of spirits, I should ne\\'er\\nHave thought, that death so many had despoil\\'d.\\n\\nWhen some of these I recogniz\\'d, I saw\\nAnd knew the shade of him, who to base fear\\nYielding, abjur\\'d his high estate.  Forthwith\\nI understood for certain this the tribe\\nOf those ill spirits both to God displeasing\\nAnd to his foes.  These wretches, who ne\\'er lived,\\nWent on in nakedness, and sorely stung\\nBy wasps and hornets, which bedew\\'d their cheeks\\nWith blood, that mix\\'d with tears dropp\\'d to their feet,\\nAnd by disgustful worms was gather\\'d there.\\n\\nThen looking farther onwards I beheld\\nA throng upon the shore of a great stream:\\nWhereat I thus: \"Sir! grant me now to know\\nWhom here we view, and whence impell\\'d they seem\\nSo eager to pass o\\'er, as I discern\\nThrough the blear light?\"  He thus to me in few:\\n\"This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive\\nBeside the woeful tide of Acheron.\"\\n\\nThen with eyes downward cast and fill\\'d with shame,\\nFearing my words offensive to his ear,\\nTill we had reach\\'d the river, I from speech\\nAbstain\\'d.  And lo! toward us in a bark\\nComes on an old man hoary white with eld,\\n\\nCrying, \"Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not\\nEver to see the sky again.  I come\\nTo take you to the other shore across,\\nInto eternal darkness, there to dwell\\nIn fierce heat and in ice.  And thou, who there\\nStandest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave\\nThese who are dead.\"  But soon as he beheld\\nI left them not, \"By other way,\" said he,\\n\"By other haven shalt thou come to shore,\\nNot by this passage; thee a nimbler boat\\nMust carry.\"  Then to him thus spake my guide:\\n\"Charon! thyself torment not: so \\'t is will\\'d,\\nWhere will and power are one: ask thou no more.\"\\n\\nStraightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks\\nOf him the boatman o\\'er the livid lake,\\nAround whose eyes glar\\'d wheeling flames.  Meanwhile\\nThose spirits, faint and naked, color chang\\'d,\\nAnd gnash\\'d their teeth, soon as the cruel words\\nThey heard.  God and their parents they blasphem\\'d,\\nThe human kind, the place, the time, and seed\\nThat did engender them and give them birth.\\n\\nThen all together sorely wailing drew\\nTo the curs\\'d strand, that every man must pass\\nWho fears not God.  Charon, demoniac form,\\nWith eyes of burning coal, collects them all,\\nBeck\\'ning, and each, that lingers, with his oar\\nStrikes.  As fall off the light autumnal leaves,\\nOne still another following, till the bough\\nStrews all its honours on the earth beneath;\\n\\nE\\'en in like manner Adam\\'s evil brood\\nCast themselves one by one down from the shore,\\nEach at a beck, as falcon at his call.\\n\\nThus go they over through the umber\\'d wave,\\nAnd ever they on the opposing bank\\nBe landed, on this side another throng\\nStill gathers.  \"Son,\" thus spake the courteous guide,\\n\"Those, who die subject to the wrath of God,\\nAll here together come from every clime,\\nAnd to o\\'erpass the river are not loth:\\nFor so heaven\\'s justice goads them on, that fear\\nIs turn\\'d into desire.  Hence ne\\'er hath past\\nGood spirit.  If of thee Charon complain,\\nNow mayst thou know the import of his words.\"\\n\\nThis said, the gloomy region trembling shook\\nSo terribly, that yet with clammy dews\\nFear chills my brow.  The sad earth gave a blast,\\nThat, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame,\\nWhich all my senses conquer\\'d quite, and I\\nDown dropp\\'d, as one with sudden slumber seiz\\'d.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO IV\\n\\nBROKE the deep slumber in my brain a crash\\nOf heavy thunder, that I shook myself,\\nAs one by main force rous\\'d.  Risen upright,\\nMy rested eyes I mov\\'d around, and search\\'d\\nWith fixed ken to know what place it was,\\nWherein I stood.  For certain on the brink\\nI found me of the lamentable vale,\\nThe dread abyss, that joins a thund\\'rous sound\\nOf plaints innumerable.  Dark and deep,\\nAnd thick with clouds o\\'erspread, mine eye in vain\\nExplor\\'d its bottom, nor could aught discern.\\n\\n\"Now let us to the blind world there beneath\\nDescend;\" the bard began all pale of look:\\n\"I go the first, and thou shalt follow next.\"\\n\\nThen I his alter\\'d hue perceiving, thus:\\n\"How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,\\nWho still art wont to comfort me in doubt?\"\\n\\nHe then: \"The anguish of that race below\\nWith pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear\\nMistakest.  Let us on.  Our length of way\\nUrges to haste.\"  Onward, this said, he mov\\'d;\\nAnd ent\\'ring led me with him on the bounds\\nOf the first circle, that surrounds th\\' abyss.\\nHere, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard\\nExcept of sighs, that made th\\' eternal air\\nTremble, not caus\\'d by tortures, but from grief\\nFelt by those multitudes, many and vast,\\nOf men, women, and infants.  Then to me\\nThe gentle guide: \"Inquir\\'st thou not what spirits\\nAre these, which thou beholdest?  Ere thou pass\\nFarther, I would thou know, that these of sin\\nWere blameless; and if aught they merited,\\nIt profits not, since baptism was not theirs,\\nThe portal to thy faith.  If they before\\nThe Gospel liv\\'d, they serv\\'d not God aright;\\nAnd among such am I. For these defects,\\nAnd for no other evil, we are lost;\"\\n\\n\"Only so far afflicted, that we live\\nDesiring without hope.\"  So grief assail\\'d\\nMy heart at hearing this, for well I knew\\nSuspended in that Limbo many a soul\\nOf mighty worth.  \"O tell me, sire rever\\'d!\\nTell me, my master!\"  I began through wish\\nOf full assurance in that holy faith,\\nWhich vanquishes all error; \"say, did e\\'er\\nAny, or through his own or other\\'s merit,\\nCome forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?\"\\n\\nPiercing the secret purport of my speech,\\nHe answer\\'d: \"I was new to that estate,\\nWhen I beheld a puissant one arrive\\nAmongst us, with victorious trophy crown\\'d.\\nHe forth the shade of our first parent drew,\\nAbel his child, and Noah righteous man,\\nOf Moses lawgiver for faith approv\\'d,\\nOf patriarch Abraham, and David king,\\nIsrael with his sire and with his sons,\\nNor without Rachel whom so hard he won,\\nAnd others many more, whom he to bliss\\nExalted.  Before these, be thou assur\\'d,\\nNo spirit of human kind was ever sav\\'d.\"\\n\\nWe, while he spake, ceas\\'d not our onward road,\\nStill passing through the wood; for so I name\\nThose spirits thick beset.  We were not far\\nOn this side from the summit, when I kenn\\'d\\nA flame, that o\\'er the darken\\'d hemisphere\\nPrevailing shin\\'d.  Yet we a little space\\nWere distant, not so far but I in part\\nDiscover\\'d, that a tribe in honour high\\nThat place possess\\'d.  \"O thou, who every art\\nAnd science valu\\'st! who are these, that boast\\nSuch honour, separate from all the rest?\"\\n\\nHe answer\\'d: \"The renown of their great names\\nThat echoes through your world above, acquires\\nFavour in heaven, which holds them thus advanc\\'d.\"\\nMeantime a voice I heard: \"Honour the bard\\nSublime! his shade returns that left us late!\"\\nNo sooner ceas\\'d the sound, than I beheld\\nFour mighty spirits toward us bend their steps,\\nOf semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.\\n\\nWhen thus my master kind began: \"Mark him,\\nWho in his right hand bears that falchion keen,\\nThe other three preceding, as their lord.\\nThis is that Homer, of all bards supreme:\\nFlaccus the next in satire\\'s vein excelling;\\nThe third is Naso; Lucan is the last.\\nBecause they all that appellation own,\\nWith which the voice singly accosted me,\\nHonouring they greet me thus, and well they judge.\"\\n\\nSo I beheld united the bright school\\nOf him the monarch of sublimest song,\\nThat o\\'er the others like an eagle soars.\\nWhen they together short discourse had held,\\nThey turn\\'d to me, with salutation kind\\nBeck\\'ning me; at the which my master smil\\'d:\\nNor was this all; but greater honour still\\nThey gave me, for they made me of their tribe;\\nAnd I was sixth amid so learn\\'d a band.\\n\\nFar as the luminous beacon on we pass\\'d\\nSpeaking of matters, then befitting well\\nTo speak, now fitter left untold.  At foot\\nOf a magnificent castle we arriv\\'d,\\nSeven times with lofty walls begirt, and round\\nDefended by a pleasant stream.  O\\'er this\\nAs o\\'er dry land we pass\\'d.  Next through seven gates\\nI with those sages enter\\'d, and we came\\nInto a mead with lively verdure fresh.\\n\\nThere dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around\\nMajestically mov\\'d, and in their port\\nBore eminent authority; they spake\\nSeldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet.\\n\\nWe to one side retir\\'d, into a place\\nOpen and bright and lofty, whence each one\\nStood manifest to view.  Incontinent\\nThere on the green enamel of the plain\\nWere shown me the great spirits, by whose sight\\nI am exalted in my own esteem.\\n\\nElectra there I saw accompanied\\nBy many, among whom Hector I knew,\\nAnchises\\' pious son, and with hawk\\'s eye\\nCaesar all arm\\'d, and by Camilla there\\nPenthesilea.  On the other side\\nOld King Latinus, seated by his child\\nLavinia, and that Brutus I beheld,\\nWho Tarquin chas\\'d, Lucretia, Cato\\'s wife\\nMarcia, with Julia and Cornelia there;\\nAnd sole apart retir\\'d, the Soldan fierce.\\n\\nThen when a little more I rais\\'d my brow,\\nI spied the master of the sapient throng,\\nSeated amid the philosophic train.\\nHim all admire, all pay him rev\\'rence due.\\nThere Socrates and Plato both I mark\\'d,\\nNearest to him in rank; Democritus,\\nWho sets the world at chance, Diogenes,\\nWith Heraclitus, and Empedocles,\\nAnd Anaxagoras, and Thales sage,\\nZeno, and Dioscorides well read\\nIn nature\\'s secret lore.  Orpheus I mark\\'d\\nAnd Linus, Tully and moral Seneca,\\nEuclid and Ptolemy, Hippocrates,\\nGalenus, Avicen, and him who made\\nThat commentary vast, Averroes.\\n\\nOf all to speak at full were vain attempt;\\nFor my wide theme so urges, that ofttimes\\nMy words fall short of what bechanc\\'d.  In two\\nThe six associates part.  Another way\\nMy sage guide leads me, from that air serene,\\nInto a climate ever vex\\'d with storms:\\nAnd to a part I come where no light shines.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO V\\n\\nFROM the first circle I descended thus\\nDown to the second, which, a lesser space\\nEmbracing, so much more of grief contains\\nProvoking bitter moans.  There, Minos stands\\nGrinning with ghastly feature: he, of all\\nWho enter, strict examining the crimes,\\n\\nGives sentence, and dismisses them beneath,\\nAccording as he foldeth him around:\\nFor when before him comes th\\' ill fated soul,\\nIt all confesses; and that judge severe\\nOf sins, considering what place in hell\\nSuits the transgression, with his tail so oft\\nHimself encircles, as degrees beneath\\nHe dooms it to descend.  Before him stand\\nAlways a num\\'rous throng; and in his turn\\nEach one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears\\nHis fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl\\'d.\\n\\n\"O thou! who to this residence of woe\\nApproachest?\"  when he saw me coming, cried\\nMinos, relinquishing his dread employ,\\n\"Look how thou enter here; beware in whom\\nThou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad\\nDeceive thee to thy harm.\"  To him my guide:\\n\"Wherefore exclaimest?  Hinder not his way\\nBy destiny appointed; so \\'tis will\\'d\\nWhere will and power are one.  Ask thou no more.\"\\n\\nNow \\'gin the rueful wailings to be heard.\\nNow am I come where many a plaining voice\\nSmites on mine ear.  Into a place I came\\nWhere light was silent all.  Bellowing there groan\\'d\\nA noise as of a sea in tempest torn\\nBy warring winds.  The stormy blast of hell\\nWith restless fury drives the spirits on\\nWhirl\\'d round and dash\\'d amain with sore annoy.\\n\\nWhen they arrive before the ruinous sweep,\\nThere shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans,\\nAnd blasphemies \\'gainst the good Power in heaven.\\n\\nI understood that to this torment sad\\nThe carnal sinners are condemn\\'d, in whom\\nReason by lust is sway\\'d.  As in large troops\\nAnd multitudinous, when winter reigns,\\nThe starlings on their wings are borne abroad;\\nSo bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls.\\nOn this side and on that, above, below,\\nIt drives them: hope of rest to solace them\\nIs none, nor e\\'en of milder pang.  As cranes,\\nChanting their dol\\'rous notes, traverse the sky,\\nStretch\\'d out in long array: so I beheld\\nSpirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on\\nBy their dire doom.  Then I: \"Instructor! who\\nAre these, by the black air so scourg\\'d?\"--\"The first\\n\\'Mong those, of whom thou question\\'st,\" he replied,\\n\"O\\'er many tongues was empress.  She in vice\\nOf luxury was so shameless, that she made\\nLiking be lawful by promulg\\'d decree,\\nTo clear the blame she had herself incurr\\'d.\\nThis is Semiramis, of whom \\'tis writ,\\nThat she succeeded Ninus her espous\\'d;\\nAnd held the land, which now the Soldan rules.\\nThe next in amorous fury slew herself,\\nAnd to Sicheus\\' ashes broke her faith:\\nThen follows Cleopatra, lustful queen.\"\\n\\nThere mark\\'d I Helen, for whose sake so long\\nThe time was fraught with evil; there the great\\nAchilles, who with love fought to the end.\\nParis I saw, and Tristan; and beside\\nA thousand more he show\\'d me, and by name\\nPointed them out, whom love bereav\\'d of life.\\n\\nWhen I had heard my sage instructor name\\nThose dames and knights of antique days, o\\'erpower\\'d\\nBy pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind\\nWas lost; and I began: \"Bard! willingly\\nI would address those two together coming,\\nWhich seem so light before the wind.\"  He thus:\\n\"Note thou, when nearer they to us approach.\"\\n\\n\"Then by that love which carries them along,\\nEntreat; and they will come.\"  Soon as the wind\\nSway\\'d them toward us, I thus fram\\'d my speech:\\n\"O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse\\nWith us, if by none else restrain\\'d.\"  As doves\\nBy fond desire invited, on wide wings\\nAnd firm, to their sweet nest returning home,\\nCleave the air, wafted by their will along;\\nThus issu\\'d from that troop, where Dido ranks,\\nThey through the ill air speeding; with such force\\nMy cry prevail\\'d by strong affection urg\\'d.\\n\\n\"O gracious creature and benign! who go\\'st\\nVisiting, through this element obscure,\\nUs, who the world with bloody stain imbru\\'d;\\nIf for a friend the King of all we own\\'d,\\nOur pray\\'r to him should for thy peace arise,\\nSince thou hast pity on our evil plight.\\n()f whatsoe\\'er to hear or to discourse\\nIt pleases thee, that will we hear, of that\\nFreely with thee discourse, while e\\'er the wind,\\nAs now, is mute.  The land, that gave me birth,\\nIs situate on the coast, where Po descends\\nTo rest in ocean with his sequent streams.\\n\\n\"Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt,\\nEntangled him by that fair form, from me\\nTa\\'en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still:\\nLove, that denial takes from none belov\\'d,\\nCaught me with pleasing him so passing well,\\nThat, as thou see\\'st, he yet deserts me not.\\n\\n\"Love brought us to one death: Caina waits\\nThe soul, who spilt our life.\"  Such were their words;\\nAt hearing which downward I bent my looks,\\nAnd held them there so long, that the bard cried:\\n\"What art thou pond\\'ring?\"  I in answer thus:\\n\"Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire\\nMust they at length to that ill pass have reach\\'d!\"\\n\\nThen turning, I to them my speech address\\'d.\\nAnd thus began: \"Francesca! your sad fate\\nEven to tears my grief and pity moves.\\nBut tell me; in the time of your sweet sighs,\\nBy what, and how love granted, that ye knew\\nYour yet uncertain wishes?\"  She replied:\\n\"No greater grief than to remember days\\nOf joy, when mis\\'ry is at hand!  That kens\\nThy learn\\'d instructor.  Yet so eagerly\\nIf thou art bent to know the primal root,\\nFrom whence our love gat being, I will do,\\nAs one, who weeps and tells his tale.  One day\\nFor our delight we read of Lancelot,\\nHow him love thrall\\'d.  Alone we were, and no\\nSuspicion near us.  Ofttimes by that reading\\nOur eyes were drawn together, and the hue\\nFled from our alter\\'d cheek.  But at one point\\nAlone we fell.  When of that smile we read,\\nThe wished smile, rapturously kiss\\'d\\nBy one so deep in love, then he, who ne\\'er\\nFrom me shall separate, at once my lips\\nAll trembling kiss\\'d.  The book and writer both\\nWere love\\'s purveyors.  In its leaves that day\\nWe read no more.\"  While thus one spirit spake,\\nThe other wail\\'d so sorely, that heartstruck\\nI through compassion fainting, seem\\'d not far\\nFrom death, and like a corpse fell to the ground.\\n\\nCANTO VI\\n\\nMY sense reviving, that erewhile had droop\\'d\\nWith pity for the kindred shades, whence grief\\nO\\'ercame me wholly, straight around I see\\nNew torments, new tormented souls, which way\\nSoe\\'er I move, or turn, or bend my sight.\\nIn the third circle I arrive, of show\\'rs\\nCeaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang\\'d\\nFor ever, both in kind and in degree.\\nLarge hail, discolour\\'d water, sleety flaw\\nThrough the dun midnight air stream\\'d down amain:\\nStank all the land whereon that tempest fell.\\n\\nCerberus, cruel monster, fierce and strange,\\nThrough his wide threefold throat barks as a dog\\nOver the multitude immers\\'d beneath.\\nHis eyes glare crimson, black his unctuous beard,\\nHis belly large, and claw\\'d the hands, with which\\nHe tears the spirits, flays them, and their limbs\\nPiecemeal disparts.  Howling there spread, as curs,\\nUnder the rainy deluge, with one side\\nThe other screening, oft they roll them round,\\nA wretched, godless crew.  When that great worm\\nDescried us, savage Cerberus, he op\\'d\\nHis jaws, and the fangs show\\'d us; not a limb\\nOf him but trembled.  Then my guide, his palms\\nExpanding on the ground, thence filled with earth\\nRais\\'d them, and cast it in his ravenous maw.\\n\\nE\\'en as a dog, that yelling bays for food\\nHis keeper, when the morsel comes, lets fall\\nHis fury, bent alone with eager haste\\nTo swallow it; so dropp\\'d the loathsome cheeks\\nOf demon Cerberus, who thund\\'ring stuns\\nThe spirits, that they for deafness wish in vain.\\n\\nWe, o\\'er the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt\\nOf the heavy tempest passing, set our feet\\nUpon their emptiness, that substance seem\\'d.\\n\\nThey all along the earth extended lay\\nSave one, that sudden rais\\'d himself to sit,\\nSoon as that way he saw us pass.  \"O thou!\"\\nHe cried, \"who through the infernal shades art led,\\nOwn, if again thou know\\'st me.  Thou wast fram\\'d\\nOr ere my frame was broken.\"  I replied:\\n\"The anguish thou endur\\'st perchance so takes\\nThy form from my remembrance, that it seems\\nAs if I saw thee never.  But inform\\nMe who thou art, that in a place so sad\\nArt set, and in such torment, that although\\nOther be greater, more disgustful none\\nCan be imagin\\'d.\"  He in answer thus:\\n\\n\"Thy city heap\\'d with envy to the brim,\\nAy that the measure overflows its bounds,\\nHeld me in brighter days.  Ye citizens\\nWere wont to name me Ciacco.  For the sin\\nOf glutt\\'ny, damned vice, beneath this rain,\\nE\\'en as thou see\\'st, I with fatigue am worn;\\nNor I sole spirit in this woe: all these\\nHave by like crime incurr\\'d like punishment.\"\\n\\nNo more he said, and I my speech resum\\'d:\\n\"Ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves me much,\\nEven to tears.  But tell me, if thou know\\'st,\\nWhat shall at length befall the citizens\\nOf the divided city; whether any just one\\nInhabit there: and tell me of the cause,\\nWhence jarring discord hath assail\\'d it thus?\"\\n\\nHe then: \"After long striving they will come\\nTo blood; and the wild party from the woods\\nWill chase the other with much injury forth.\\nThen it behoves, that this must fall, within\\nThree solar circles; and the other rise\\nBy borrow\\'d force of one, who under shore\\nNow rests.  It shall a long space hold aloof\\nIts forehead, keeping under heavy weight\\nThe other oppress\\'d, indignant at the load,\\nAnd grieving sore.  The just are two in number,\\nBut they neglected.  Av\\'rice, envy, pride,\\nThree fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all\\nOn fire.\"  Here ceas\\'d the lamentable sound;\\nAnd I continu\\'d thus: \"Still would I learn\\nMore from thee, farther parley still entreat.\\nOf Farinata and Tegghiaio say,\\nThey who so well deserv\\'d, of Giacopo,\\nArrigo, Mosca, and the rest, who bent\\nTheir minds on working good.  Oh! tell me where\\nThey bide, and to their knowledge let me come.\\nFor I am press\\'d with keen desire to hear,\\nIf heaven\\'s sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell\\nBe to their lip assign\\'d.\"   He answer\\'d straight:\\n\"These are yet blacker spirits.  Various crimes\\nHave sunk them deeper in the dark abyss.\\nIf thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them.\\nBut to the pleasant world when thou return\\'st,\\nOf me make mention, I entreat thee, there.\\nNo more I tell thee, answer thee no more.\"\\n\\nThis said, his fixed eyes he turn\\'d askance,\\nA little ey\\'d me, then bent down his head,\\nAnd \\'midst his blind companions with it fell.\\n\\nWhen thus my guide: \"No more his bed he leaves,\\nEre the last angel-trumpet blow.  The Power\\nAdverse to these shall then in glory come,\\nEach one forthwith to his sad tomb repair,\\nResume his fleshly vesture and his form,\\nAnd hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend\\nThe vault.\"  So pass\\'d we through that mixture foul\\nOf spirits and rain, with tardy steps; meanwhile\\nTouching, though slightly, on the life to come.\\nFor thus I question\\'d: \"Shall these tortures, Sir!\\nWhen the great sentence passes, be increas\\'d,\\nOr mitigated, or as now severe?\"\\n\\nHe then: \"Consult thy knowledge; that decides\\nThat as each thing to more perfection grows,\\nIt feels more sensibly both good and pain.\\nThough ne\\'er to true perfection may arrive\\nThis race accurs\\'d, yet nearer then than now\\nThey shall approach it.\"  Compassing that path\\nCircuitous we journeyed, and discourse\\nMuch more than I relate between us pass\\'d:\\nTill at the point, where the steps led below,\\nArriv\\'d, there Plutus, the great foe, we found.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO VII\\n\\n\"AH me!  O Satan!  Satan!\" loud exclaim\\'d\\nPlutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm:\\nAnd the kind sage, whom no event surpris\\'d,\\nTo comfort me thus spake: \"Let not thy fear\\nHarm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none\\nTo hinder down this rock thy safe descent.\"\\nThen to that sworn lip turning, \"Peace!\"  he cried,\\n\\n\"Curs\\'d wolf! thy fury inward on thyself\\nPrey, and consume thee!  Through the dark profound\\nNot without cause he passes.  So \\'t is will\\'d\\nOn high, there where the great Archangel pour\\'d\\nHeav\\'n\\'s vengeance on the first adulterer proud.\"\\n\\nAs sails full spread and bellying with the wind\\nDrop suddenly collaps\\'d, if the mast split;\\nSo to the ground down dropp\\'d the cruel fiend.\\n\\nThus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge,\\nGain\\'d on the dismal shore, that all the woe\\nHems in of all the universe.  Ah me!\\nAlmighty Justice! in what store thou heap\\'st\\nNew pains, new troubles, as I here beheld!\\nWherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?\\n\\nE\\'en as a billow, on Charybdis rising,\\nAgainst encounter\\'d billow dashing breaks;\\nSuch is the dance this wretched race must lead,\\nWhom more than elsewhere numerous here I found,\\nFrom one side and the other, with loud voice,\\nBoth roll\\'d on weights by main forge of their breasts,\\nThen smote together, and each one forthwith\\nRoll\\'d them back voluble, turning again,\\nExclaiming these, \"Why holdest thou so fast?\"\\nThose answering, \"And why castest thou away?\"\\nSo still repeating their despiteful song,\\nThey to the opposite point on either hand\\nTravers\\'d the horrid circle: then arriv\\'d,\\nBoth turn\\'d them round, and through the middle space\\nConflicting met again.  At sight whereof\\nI, stung with grief, thus spake: \"O say, my guide!\\nWhat race is this?  Were these, whose heads are shorn,\\nOn our left hand, all sep\\'rate to the church?\"\\n\\nHe straight replied: \"In their first life these all\\nIn mind were so distorted, that they made,\\nAccording to due measure, of their wealth,\\nNo use.  This clearly from their words collect,\\nWhich they howl forth, at each extremity\\nArriving of the circle, where their crime\\nContrary\\' in kind disparts them.  To the church\\nWere separate those, that with no hairy cowls\\nAre crown\\'d, both Popes and Cardinals, o\\'er whom\\nAv\\'rice dominion absolute maintains.\"\\n\\nI then: \"Mid such as these some needs must be,\\nWhom I shall recognize, that with the blot\\nOf these foul sins were stain\\'d.\"  He answering thus:\\n\"Vain thought conceiv\\'st thou.  That ignoble life,\\nWhich made them vile before, now makes them dark,\\nAnd to all knowledge indiscernible.\\nForever they shall meet in this rude shock:\\nThese from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise,\\nThose with close-shaven locks.  That ill they gave,\\nAnd ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world\\nDepriv\\'d, and set them at this strife, which needs\\nNo labour\\'d phrase of mine to set if off.\\nNow may\\'st thou see, my son! how brief, how vain,\\nThe goods committed into fortune\\'s hands,\\nFor which the human race keep such a coil!\\nNot all the gold, that is beneath the moon,\\nOr ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls\\nMight purchase rest for one.\"  I thus rejoin\\'d:\\n\\n\"My guide! of thee this also would I learn;\\nThis fortune, that thou speak\\'st of, what it is,\\nWhose talons grasp the blessings of the world?\"\\n\\nHe thus: \"O beings blind! what ignorance\\nBesets you?  Now my judgment hear and mark.\\nHe, whose transcendent wisdom passes all,\\nThe heavens creating, gave them ruling powers\\nTo guide them, so that each part shines to each,\\nTheir light in equal distribution pour\\'d.\\nBy similar appointment he ordain\\'d\\nOver the world\\'s bright images to rule.\\nSuperintendence of a guiding hand\\nAnd general minister, which at due time\\nMay change the empty vantages of life\\nFrom race to race, from one to other\\'s blood,\\nBeyond prevention of man\\'s wisest care:\\nWherefore one nation rises into sway,\\nAnother languishes, e\\'en as her will\\nDecrees, from us conceal\\'d, as in the grass\\nThe serpent train.  Against her nought avails\\nYour utmost wisdom.  She with foresight plans,\\nJudges, and carries on her reign, as theirs\\nThe other powers divine.  Her changes know\\nNore intermission: by necessity\\nShe is made swift, so frequent come who claim\\nSuccession in her favours.  This is she,\\nSo execrated e\\'en by those, whose debt\\nTo her is rather praise; they wrongfully\\nWith blame requite her, and with evil word;\\nBut she is blessed, and for that recks not:\\nAmidst the other primal beings glad\\nRolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults.\\nNow on our way pass we, to heavier woe\\nDescending: for each star is falling now,\\nThat mounted at our entrance, and forbids\\nToo long our tarrying.\"  We the circle cross\\'d\\nTo the next steep, arriving at a well,\\nThat boiling pours itself down to a foss\\nSluic\\'d from its source.  Far murkier was the wave\\nThan sablest grain: and we in company\\nOf the\\' inky waters, journeying by their side,\\nEnter\\'d, though by a different track, beneath.\\nInto a lake, the Stygian nam\\'d, expands\\nThe dismal stream, when it hath reach\\'d the foot\\nOf the grey wither\\'d cliffs.  Intent I stood\\nTo gaze, and in the marish sunk descried\\nA miry tribe, all naked, and with looks\\nBetok\\'ning rage.  They with their hands alone\\nStruck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet,\\nCutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.\\n\\nThe good instructor spake; \"Now seest thou, son!\\nThe souls of those, whom anger overcame.\\nThis too for certain know, that underneath\\nThe water dwells a multitude, whose sighs\\nInto these bubbles make the surface heave,\\nAs thine eye tells thee wheresoe\\'er it turn.\"\\nFix\\'d in the slime they say: \"Sad once were we\\nIn the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,\\nCarrying a foul and lazy mist within:\\nNow in these murky settlings are we sad.\"\\nSuch dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats.\\nBut word distinct can utter none.\"  Our route\\nThus compass\\'d we, a segment widely stretch\\'d\\nBetween the dry embankment, and the core\\nOf the loath\\'d pool, turning meanwhile our eyes\\nDownward on those who gulp\\'d its muddy lees;\\nNor stopp\\'d, till to a tower\\'s low base we came.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO VIII\\n\\nMY theme pursuing, I relate that ere\\nWe reach\\'d the lofty turret\\'s base, our eyes\\nIts height ascended, where two cressets hung\\nWe mark\\'d, and from afar another light\\nReturn the signal, so remote, that scarce\\nThe eye could catch its beam.  I turning round\\nTo the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir\\'d:\\n\"Say what this means?  and what that other light\\nIn answer set?  what agency doth this?\"\\n\\n\"There on the filthy waters,\" he replied,\\n\"E\\'en now what next awaits us mayst thou see,\\nIf the marsh-gender\\'d fog conceal it not.\"\\n\\nNever was arrow from the cord dismiss\\'d,\\nThat ran its way so nimbly through the air,\\nAs a small bark, that through the waves I spied\\nToward us coming, under the sole sway\\nOf one that ferried it, who cried aloud:\\n\"Art thou arriv\\'d, fell spirit?\"--\"Phlegyas, Phlegyas,\\nThis time thou criest in vain,\" my lord replied;\\n\"No longer shalt thou have us, but while o\\'er\\nThe slimy pool we pass.\"  As one who hears\\nOf some great wrong he hath sustain\\'d, whereat\\nInly he pines; so Phlegyas inly pin\\'d\\nIn his fierce ire.  My guide descending stepp\\'d\\nInto the skiff, and bade me enter next\\nClose at his side; nor till my entrance seem\\'d\\nThe vessel freighted.  Soon as both embark\\'d,\\nCutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,\\nMore deeply than with others it is wont.\\n\\nWhile we our course o\\'er the dead channel held.\\nOne drench\\'d in mire before me came, and said;\\n\"Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?\"\\n\\nI answer\\'d: \"Though I come, I tarry not;\\nBut who art thou, that art become so foul?\"\\n\\n\"One, as thou seest, who mourn:\" he straight replied.\\n\\nTo which I thus: \"In mourning and in woe,\\nCurs\\'d spirit! tarry thou.g I know thee well,\\nE\\'en thus in filth disguis\\'d.\"  Then stretch\\'d he forth\\nHands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage\\nAware, thrusting him back: \"Away! down there;\\n\\n\"To the\\' other dogs!\" then, with his arms my neck\\nEncircling, kiss\\'d my cheek, and spake: \"O soul\\nJustly disdainful! blest was she in whom\\nThou was conceiv\\'d!  He in the world was one\\nFor arrogance noted; to his memory\\nNo virtue lends its lustre; even so\\nHere is his shadow furious.  There above\\nHow many now hold themselves mighty kings\\nWho here like swine shall wallow in the mire,\\nLeaving behind them horrible dispraise!\"\\n\\nI then: \"Master! him fain would I behold\\nWhelm\\'d in these dregs, before we quit the lake.\"\\n\\nHe thus: \"Or ever to thy view the shore\\nBe offer\\'d, satisfied shall be that wish,\\nWhich well deserves completion.\"  Scarce his words\\nWere ended, when I saw the miry tribes\\nSet on him with such violence, that yet\\nFor that render I thanks to God and praise\\n\"To Filippo Argenti:\" cried they all:\\nAnd on himself the moody Florentine\\nTurn\\'d his avenging fangs.  Him here we left,\\nNor speak I of him more.  But on mine ear\\nSudden a sound of lamentation smote,\\nWhereat mine eye unbarr\\'d I sent abroad.\\n\\nAnd thus the good instructor: \"Now, my son!\\nDraws near the city, that of Dis is nam\\'d,\\nWith its grave denizens, a mighty throng.\"\\n\\nI thus: \"The minarets already, Sir!\\nThere certes in the valley I descry,\\nGleaming vermilion, as if they from fire\\nHad issu\\'d.\"  He replied: \"Eternal fire,\\nThat inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame\\nIllum\\'d; as in this nether hell thou seest.\"\\n\\nWe came within the fosses deep, that moat\\nThis region comfortless.  The walls appear\\'d\\nAs they were fram\\'d of iron.  We had made\\nWide circuit, ere a place we reach\\'d, where loud\\nThe mariner cried vehement: \"Go forth!\\nThe\\' entrance is here!\"  Upon the gates I spied\\nMore than a thousand, who of old from heaven\\nWere hurl\\'d.  With ireful gestures, \"Who is this,\"\\nThey cried, \"that without death first felt, goes through\\nThe regions of the dead?\"  My sapient guide\\nMade sign that he for secret parley wish\\'d;\\nWhereat their angry scorn abating, thus\\nThey spake: \"Come thou alone; and let him go\\nWho hath so hardily enter\\'d this realm.\\nAlone return he by his witless way;\\nIf well he know it, let him prove.  For thee,\\nHere shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark\\nHast been his escort.\" Now bethink thee, reader!\\nWhat cheer was mine at sound of those curs\\'d words.\\nI did believe I never should return.\\n\\n\"O my lov\\'d guide! who more than seven times\\nSecurity hast render\\'d me, and drawn\\nFrom peril deep, whereto I stood expos\\'d,\\nDesert me not,\" I cried, \"in this extreme.\\nAnd if our onward going be denied,\\nTogether trace we back our steps with speed.\"\\n\\nMy liege, who thither had conducted me,\\nReplied: \"Fear not: for of our passage none\\nHath power to disappoint us, by such high\\nAuthority permitted.  But do thou\\nExpect me here; meanwhile thy wearied spirit\\nComfort, and feed with kindly hope, assur\\'d\\nI will not leave thee in this lower world.\"\\n\\nThis said, departs the sire benevolent,\\nAnd quits me.  Hesitating I remain\\nAt war \\'twixt will and will not in my thoughts.\\n\\nI could not hear what terms he offer\\'d them,\\nBut they conferr\\'d not long, for all at once\\nTo trial fled within.  Clos\\'d were the gates\\nBy those our adversaries on the breast\\nOf my liege lord: excluded he return\\'d\\nTo me with tardy steps.  Upon the ground\\nHis eyes were bent, and from his brow eras\\'d\\nAll confidence, while thus with sighs he spake:\\n\"Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?\"\\nThen thus to me: \"That I am anger\\'d, think\\nNo ground of terror: in this trial I\\nShall vanquish, use what arts they may within\\nFor hindrance.  This their insolence, not new,\\nErewhile at gate less secret they display\\'d,\\nWhich still is without bolt; upon its arch\\nThou saw\\'st the deadly scroll: and even now\\nOn this side of its entrance, down the steep,\\nPassing the circles, unescorted, comes\\nOne whose strong might can open us this land.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO IX\\n\\nTHE hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks\\nImprinted, when I saw my guide turn back,\\nChas\\'d that from his which newly they had worn,\\nAnd inwardly restrain\\'d it.  He, as one\\nWho listens, stood attentive: for his eye\\nNot far could lead him through the sable air,\\nAnd the thick-gath\\'ring cloud.  \"It yet behooves\\nWe win this fight\"--thus he began--\"if not--\\nSuch aid to us is offer\\'d.--Oh, how long\\nMe seems it, ere the promis\\'d help arrive!\"\\n\\nI noted, how the sequel of his words\\nClok\\'d their beginning; for the last he spake\\nAgreed not with the first.  But not the less\\nMy fear was at his saying; sith I drew\\nTo import worse perchance, than that he held,\\nHis mutilated speech.  \"Doth ever any\\nInto this rueful concave\\'s extreme depth\\nDescend, out of the first degree, whose pain\\nIs deprivation merely of sweet hope?\"\\n\\nThus I inquiring. \"Rarely,\" he replied,\\n\"It chances, that among us any makes\\nThis journey, which I wend.  Erewhile \\'tis true\\nOnce came I here beneath, conjur\\'d by fell\\nErictho, sorceress, who compell\\'d the shades\\nBack to their bodies.  No long space my flesh\\nWas naked of me, when within these walls\\nShe made me enter, to draw forth a spirit\\nFrom out of Judas\\' circle.  Lowest place\\nIs that of all, obscurest, and remov\\'d\\nFarthest from heav\\'n\\'s all-circling orb.  The road\\nFull well I know: thou therefore rest secure.\\nThat lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round\\nThe city\\' of grief encompasses, which now\\nWe may not enter without rage.\"  Yet more\\nHe added: but I hold it not in mind,\\nFor that mine eye toward the lofty tower\\nHad drawn me wholly, to its burning top.\\nWhere in an instant I beheld uprisen\\nAt once three hellish furies stain\\'d with blood:\\nIn limb and motion feminine they seem\\'d;\\nAround them greenest hydras twisting roll\\'d\\nTheir volumes; adders and cerastes crept\\nInstead of hair, and their fierce temples bound.\\n\\nHe knowing well the miserable hags\\nWho tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake:\\n\\n\"Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left\\nThis is Megaera; on the right hand she,\\nWho wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone\\nI\\' th\\' midst.\"  This said, in silence he remain\\'d\\nTheir breast they each one clawing tore; themselves\\nSmote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais\\'d,\\nThat to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound.\\n\"Hasten Medusa: so to adamant\\nHim shall we change;\" all looking down exclaim\\'d.\\n\"E\\'en when by Theseus\\' might assail\\'d, we took\\nNo ill revenge.\"  \"Turn thyself round, and keep\\nThy count\\'nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire\\nBe shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return\\nUpwards would be for ever lost.\"  This said,\\nHimself my gentle master turn\\'d me round,\\nNor trusted he my hands, but with his own\\nHe also hid me.  Ye of intellect\\nSound and entire, mark well the lore conceal\\'d\\nUnder close texture of the mystic strain!\\n\\nAnd now there came o\\'er the perturbed waves\\nLoud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made\\nEither shore tremble, as if of a wind\\nImpetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung,\\nThat \\'gainst some forest driving all its might,\\nPlucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls\\nAfar; then onward passing proudly sweeps\\nIts whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly.\\n\\nMine eyes he loos\\'d, and spake: \"And now direct\\nThy visual nerve along that ancient foam,\\nThere, thickest where the smoke ascends.\" As frogs\\nBefore their foe the serpent, through the wave\\nPly swiftly all, till at the ground each one\\nLies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits\\nDestroy\\'d, so saw I fleeing before one\\nWho pass\\'d with unwet feet the Stygian sound.\\nHe, from his face removing the gross air,\\nOft his left hand forth stretch\\'d, and seem\\'d alone\\nBy that annoyance wearied.  I perceiv\\'d\\nThat he was sent from heav\\'n, and to my guide\\nTurn\\'d me, who signal made that I should stand\\nQuiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full\\nOf noble anger seem\\'d he!  To the gate\\nHe came, and with his wand touch\\'d it, whereat\\nOpen without impediment it flew.\\n\\n\"Outcasts of heav\\'n!  O abject race and scorn\\'d!\"\\nBegan he on the horrid grunsel standing,\\n\"Whence doth this wild excess of insolence\\nLodge in you? wherefore kick you \\'gainst that will\\nNe\\'er frustrate of its end, and which so oft\\nHath laid on you enforcement of your pangs?\\nWhat profits at the fays to but the horn?\\nYour Cerberus, if ye remember, hence\\nBears still, peel\\'d of their hair, his throat and maw.\"\\n\\nThis said, he turn\\'d back o\\'er the filthy way,\\nAnd syllable to us spake none, but wore\\nThe semblance of a man by other care\\nBeset, and keenly press\\'d, than thought of him\\nWho in his presence stands.  Then we our steps\\nToward that territory mov\\'d, secure\\nAfter the hallow\\'d words.  We unoppos\\'d\\nThere enter\\'d; and my mind eager to learn\\nWhat state a fortress like to that might hold,\\nI soon as enter\\'d throw mine eye around,\\nAnd see on every part wide-stretching space\\nReplete with bitter pain and torment ill.\\n\\nAs where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles,\\nOr as at Pola, near Quarnaro\\'s gulf,\\nThat closes Italy and laves her bounds,\\nThe place is all thick spread with sepulchres;\\nSo was it here, save what in horror here\\nExcell\\'d: for \\'midst the graves were scattered flames,\\nWherewith intensely all throughout they burn\\'d,\\nThat iron for no craft there hotter needs.\\n\\nTheir lids all hung suspended, and beneath\\nFrom them forth issu\\'d lamentable moans,\\nSuch as the sad and tortur\\'d well might raise.\\n\\nI thus: \"Master! say who are these, interr\\'d\\nWithin these vaults, of whom distinct we hear\\nThe dolorous sighs?\"  He answer thus return\\'d:\\n\\n\"The arch-heretics are here, accompanied\\nBy every sect their followers; and much more,\\nThan thou believest, tombs are freighted: like\\nWith like is buried; and the monuments\\nAre different in degrees of heat.\"  This said,\\nHe to the right hand turning, on we pass\\'d\\nBetwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO X\\n\\nNOW by a secret pathway we proceed,\\nBetween the walls, that hem the region round,\\nAnd the tormented souls: my master first,\\nI close behind his steps.  \"Virtue supreme!\"\\nI thus began; \"who through these ample orbs\\nIn circuit lead\\'st me, even as thou will\\'st,\\nSpeak thou, and satisfy my wish.  May those,\\nWho lie within these sepulchres, be seen?\\nAlready all the lids are rais\\'d, and none\\nO\\'er them keeps watch.\"  He thus in answer spake\\n\"They shall be closed all, what-time they here\\nFrom Josaphat return\\'d shall come, and bring\\nTheir bodies, which above they now have left.\\nThe cemetery on this part obtain\\nWith Epicurus all his followers,\\nWho with the body make the spirit die.\\nHere therefore satisfaction shall be soon\\nBoth to the question ask\\'d, and to the wish,\\nWhich thou conceal\\'st in silence.\"  I replied:\\n\"I keep not, guide belov\\'d! from thee my heart\\nSecreted, but to shun vain length of words,\\nA lesson erewhile taught me by thyself.\"\\n\\n\"O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire\\nAlive art passing, so discreet of speech!\\nHere please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance\\nDeclares the place of thy nativity\\nTo be that noble land, with which perchance\\nI too severely dealt.\"  Sudden that sound\\nForth issu\\'d from a vault, whereat in fear\\nI somewhat closer to my leader\\'s side\\nApproaching, he thus spake: \"What dost thou?  Turn.\\nLo, Farinata, there! who hath himself\\nUplifted: from his girdle upwards all\\nExpos\\'d behold him.\"  On his face was mine\\nAlready fix\\'d; his breast and forehead there\\nErecting, seem\\'d as in high scorn he held\\nE\\'en hell.  Between the sepulchres to him\\nMy guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt,\\nThis warning added: \"See thy words be clear!\"\\n\\nHe, soon as there I stood at the tomb\\'s foot,\\nEy\\'d me a space, then in disdainful mood\\nAddress\\'d me: \"Say, what ancestors were thine?\"\\n\\nI, willing to obey him, straight reveal\\'d\\nThe whole, nor kept back aught: whence he, his brow\\nSomewhat uplifting, cried: \"Fiercely were they\\nAdverse to me, my party, and the blood\\nFrom whence I sprang: twice therefore I abroad\\nScatter\\'d them.\"  \"Though driv\\'n out, yet they each time\\nFrom all parts,\" answer\\'d I, \"return\\'d; an art\\nWhich yours have shown, they are not skill\\'d to learn.\"\\n\\nThen, peering forth from the unclosed jaw,\\nRose from his side a shade, high as the chin,\\nLeaning, methought, upon its knees uprais\\'d.\\nIt look\\'d around, as eager to explore\\nIf there were other with me; but perceiving\\nThat fond imagination quench\\'d, with tears\\nThus spake: \"If thou through this blind prison go\\'st.\\nLed by thy lofty genius and profound,\\nWhere is my son? and wherefore not with thee?\"\\n\\nI straight replied: \"Not of myself I come,\\nBy him, who there expects me, through this clime\\nConducted, whom perchance Guido thy son\\nHad in contempt.\"  Already had his words\\nAnd mode of punishment read me his name,\\nWhence I so fully answer\\'d.  He at once\\nExclaim\\'d, up starting, \"How! said\\'st thou he HAD?\\nNo longer lives he?  Strikes not on his eye\\nThe blessed daylight?\"  Then of some delay\\nI made ere my reply aware, down fell\\nSupine, not after forth appear\\'d he more.\\n\\nMeanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom\\nI yet was station\\'d, chang\\'d not count\\'nance stern,\\nNor mov\\'d the neck, nor bent his ribbed side.\\n\"And if,\" continuing the first discourse,\\n\"They in this art,\" he cried, \"small skill have shown,\\nThat doth torment me more e\\'en than this bed.\\nBut not yet fifty times shall be relum\\'d\\nHer aspect, who reigns here Queen of this realm,\\nEre thou shalt know the full weight of that art.\\nSo to the pleasant world mayst thou return,\\nAs thou shalt tell me, why in all their laws,\\nAgainst my kin this people is so fell?\"\\n\\n\"The slaughter and great havoc,\" I replied,\\n\"That colour\\'d Arbia\\'s flood with crimson stain--\\nTo these impute, that in our hallow\\'d dome\\nSuch orisons ascend.\"  Sighing he shook\\nThe head, then thus resum\\'d: \"In that affray\\nI stood not singly, nor without just cause\\nAssuredly should with the rest have stirr\\'d;\\nBut singly there I stood, when by consent\\nOf all, Florence had to the ground been raz\\'d,\\nThe one who openly forbad the deed.\"\\n\\n\"So may thy lineage find at last repose,\"\\nI thus adjur\\'d him, \"as thou solve this knot,\\nWhich now involves my mind.  If right I hear,\\nYe seem to view beforehand, that which time\\nLeads with him, of the present uninform\\'d.\"\\n\\n\"We view, as one who hath an evil sight,\"\\nHe answer\\'d, \"plainly, objects far remote:\\nSo much of his large spendour yet imparts\\nThe\\' Almighty Ruler; but when they approach\\nOr actually exist, our intellect\\nThen wholly fails, nor of your human state\\nExcept what others bring us know we aught.\\nHence therefore mayst thou understand, that all\\nOur knowledge in that instant shall expire,\\nWhen on futurity the portals close.\"\\n\\nThen conscious of my fault, and by remorse\\nSmitten, I added thus: \"Now shalt thou say\\nTo him there fallen, that his offspring still\\nIs to the living join\\'d; and bid him know,\\nThat if from answer silent I abstain\\'d,\\n\\'Twas that my thought was occupied intent\\nUpon that error, which thy help hath solv\\'d.\"\\n\\nBut now my master summoning me back\\nI heard, and with more eager haste besought\\nThe spirit to inform me, who with him\\nPartook his lot.  He answer thus return\\'d:\\n\\n\"More than a thousand with me here are laid\\nWithin is Frederick, second of that name,\\nAnd the Lord Cardinal, and of the rest\\nI speak not.\"  He, this said, from sight withdrew.\\nBut I my steps towards the ancient bard\\nReverting, ruminated on the words\\nBetokening me such ill.  Onward he mov\\'d,\\nAnd thus in going question\\'d: \"Whence the\\' amaze\\nThat holds thy senses wrapt?\"  I satisfied\\nThe\\' inquiry, and the sage enjoin\\'d me straight:\\n\"Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard\\nTo thee importing harm; and note thou this,\"\\nWith his rais\\'d finger bidding me take heed,\\n\\n\"When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam,\\nWhose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life\\nThe future tenour will to thee unfold.\"\\n\\nForthwith he to the left hand turn\\'d his feet:\\nWe left the wall, and tow\\'rds the middle space\\nWent by a path, that to a valley strikes;\\nWhich e\\'en thus high exhal\\'d its noisome steam.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XI\\n\\nUPON the utmost verge of a high bank,\\nBy craggy rocks environ\\'d round, we came,\\nWhere woes beneath more cruel yet were stow\\'d:\\nAnd here to shun the horrible excess\\nOf fetid exhalation, upward cast\\nFrom the profound abyss, behind the lid\\nOf a great monument we stood retir\\'d,\\n\\nWhereon this scroll I mark\\'d: \"I have in charge\\nPope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew\\nFrom the right path.--Ere our descent behooves\\nWe make delay, that somewhat first the sense,\\nTo the dire breath accustom\\'d, afterward\\nRegard it not.\"  My master thus; to whom\\nAnswering I spake: \"Some compensation find\\nThat the time past not wholly lost.\"  He then:\\n\"Lo! how my thoughts e\\'en to thy wishes tend!\\nMy son! within these rocks,\" he thus began,\\n\"Are three close circles in gradation plac\\'d,\\nAs these which now thou leav\\'st. Each one is full\\nOf spirits accurs\\'d; but that the sight alone\\nHereafter may suffice thee, listen how\\nAnd for what cause in durance they abide.\\n\\n\"Of all malicious act abhorr\\'d in heaven,\\nThe end is injury; and all such end\\nEither by force or fraud works other\\'s woe\\nBut fraud, because of man peculiar evil,\\nTo God is more displeasing; and beneath\\nThe fraudulent are therefore doom\\'d to\\' endure\\nSeverer pang.  The violent occupy\\nAll the first circle; and because to force\\nThree persons are obnoxious, in three rounds\\nHach within other sep\\'rate is it fram\\'d.\\nTo God, his neighbour, and himself, by man\\nForce may be offer\\'d; to himself I say\\nAnd his possessions, as thou soon shalt hear\\nAt full.  Death, violent death, and painful wounds\\nUpon his neighbour he inflicts; and wastes\\nBy devastation, pillage, and the flames,\\nHis substance.  Slayers, and each one that smites\\nIn malice, plund\\'rers, and all robbers, hence\\nThe torment undergo of the first round\\nIn different herds.  Man can do violence\\nTo himself and his own blessings: and for this\\nHe in the second round must aye deplore\\nWith unavailing penitence his crime,\\nWhoe\\'er deprives himself of life and light,\\nIn reckless lavishment his talent wastes,\\nAnd sorrows there where he should dwell in joy.\\nTo God may force be offer\\'d, in the heart\\nDenying and blaspheming his high power,\\nAnd nature with her kindly law contemning.\\nAnd thence the inmost round marks with its seal\\nSodom and Cahors, and all such as speak\\nContemptuously\\' of the Godhead in their hearts.\\n\\n\"Fraud, that in every conscience leaves a sting,\\nMay be by man employ\\'d on one, whose trust\\nHe wins, or on another who withholds\\nStrict confidence.  Seems as the latter way\\nBroke but the bond of love which Nature makes.\\nWhence in the second circle have their nest\\nDissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries,\\nTheft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce\\nTo lust, or set their honesty at pawn,\\nWith such vile scum as these.  The other way\\nForgets both Nature\\'s general love, and that\\nWhich thereto added afterwards gives birth\\nTo special faith.  Whence in the lesser circle,\\nPoint of the universe, dread seat of Dis,\\nThe traitor is eternally consum\\'d.\"\\n\\nI thus: \"Instructor, clearly thy discourse\\nProceeds, distinguishing the hideous chasm\\nAnd its inhabitants with skill exact.\\nBut tell me this: they of the dull, fat pool,\\nWhom the rain beats, or whom the tempest drives,\\nOr who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet,\\nWherefore within the city fire-illum\\'d\\nAre not these punish\\'d, if God\\'s wrath be on them?\\nAnd if it be not, wherefore in such guise\\nAre they condemned?\"  He answer thus return\\'d:\\n\"Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind,\\nNot so accustom\\'d? or what other thoughts\\nPossess it?  Dwell not in thy memory\\nThe words, wherein thy ethic page describes\\nThree dispositions adverse to Heav\\'n\\'s will,\\nIncont\\'nence, malice, and mad brutishness,\\nAnd how incontinence the least offends\\nGod, and least guilt incurs?  If well thou note\\nThis judgment, and remember who they are,\\nWithout these walls to vain repentance doom\\'d,\\nThou shalt discern why they apart are plac\\'d\\nFrom these fell spirits, and less wreakful pours\\nJustice divine on them its vengeance down.\"\\n\\n\"O Sun! who healest all imperfect sight,\\nThou so content\\'st me, when thou solv\\'st my doubt,\\nThat ignorance not less than knowledge charms.\\nYet somewhat turn thee back,\" I in these words\\nContinu\\'d, \"where thou saidst, that usury\\nOffends celestial Goodness; and this knot\\nPerplex\\'d unravel.\"  He thus made reply:\\n\"Philosophy, to an attentive ear,\\nClearly points out, not in one part alone,\\nHow imitative nature takes her course\\nFrom the celestial mind and from its art:\\nAnd where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds,\\nNot many leaves scann\\'d o\\'er, observing well\\nThou shalt discover, that your art on her\\nObsequious follows, as the learner treads\\nIn his instructor\\'s step, so that your art\\nDeserves the name of second in descent\\nFrom God.  These two, if thou recall to mind\\nCreation\\'s holy book, from the beginning\\nWere the right source of life and excellence\\nTo human kind.  But in another path\\nThe usurer walks; and Nature in herself\\nAnd in her follower thus he sets at nought,\\nPlacing elsewhere his hope.  But follow now\\nMy steps on forward journey bent; for now\\nThe Pisces play with undulating glance\\nAlong the\\' horizon, and the Wain lies all\\nO\\'er the north-west; and onward there a space\\nIs our steep passage down the rocky height.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XII\\n\\nTHE place where to descend the precipice\\nWe came, was rough as Alp, and on its verge\\nSuch object lay, as every eye would shun.\\n\\nAs is that ruin, which Adice\\'s stream\\nOn this side Trento struck, should\\'ring the wave,\\nOr loos\\'d by earthquake or for lack of prop;\\nFor from the mountain\\'s summit, whence it mov\\'d\\nTo the low level, so the headlong rock\\nIs shiver\\'d, that some passage it might give\\nTo him who from above would pass; e\\'en such\\nInto the chasm was that descent: and there\\nAt point of the disparted ridge lay stretch\\'d\\nThe infamy of Crete, detested brood\\nOf the feign\\'d heifer: and at sight of us\\nIt gnaw\\'d itself, as one with rage distract.\\n\\nTo him my guide exclaim\\'d: \"Perchance thou deem\\'st\\nThe King of Athens here, who, in the world\\nAbove, thy death contriv\\'d.  Monster! avaunt!\\nHe comes not tutor\\'d by thy sister\\'s art,\\nBut to behold your torments is he come.\"\\n\\nLike to a bull, that with impetuous spring\\nDarts, at the moment when the fatal blow\\nHath struck him, but unable to proceed\\nPlunges on either side; so saw I plunge\\nThe Minotaur; whereat the sage exclaim\\'d:\\n\"Run to the passage! while he storms, \\'t is well\\nThat thou descend.\"  Thus down our road we took\\nThrough those dilapidated crags, that oft\\nMov\\'d underneath my feet, to weight like theirs\\nUnus\\'d.  I pond\\'ring went, and thus he spake:\\n\\n\"Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin\\'d steep,\\nGuarded by the brute violence, which I\\nHave vanquish\\'d now. Know then, that when I erst\\nHither descended to the nether hell,\\nThis rock was not yet fallen.  But past doubt\\n(If well I mark) not long ere He arrived,\\nWho carried off from Dis the mighty spoil\\nOf the highest circle, then through all its bounds\\nSuch trembling seiz\\'d the deep concave and foul,\\nI thought the universe was thrill\\'d with love,\\nWhereby, there are who deem, the world hath oft\\nBeen into chaos turn\\'d: and in that point,\\nHere, and elsewhere, that old rock toppled down.\\nBut fix thine eyes beneath: the river of blood\\nApproaches, in the which all those are steep\\'d,\\nWho have by violence injur\\'d.\"  O blind lust!\\nO foolish wrath! who so dost goad us on\\nIn the brief life, and in the eternal then\\nThus miserably o\\'erwhelm us.  I beheld\\nAn ample foss, that in a bow was bent,\\nAs circling all the plain; for so my guide\\nHad told.  Between it and the rampart\\'s base\\nOn trail ran Centaurs, with keen arrows arm\\'d,\\nAs to the chase they on the earth were wont.\\n\\nAt seeing us descend they each one stood;\\nAnd issuing from the troop, three sped with bows\\nAnd missile weapons chosen first; of whom\\nOne cried from far: \"Say to what pain ye come\\nCondemn\\'d, who down this steep have journied?  Speak\\nFrom whence ye stand, or else the bow I draw.\"\\n\\nTo whom my guide: \"Our answer shall be made\\nTo Chiron, there, when nearer him we come.\\nIll was thy mind, thus ever quick and rash.\"\\n\\nThen me he touch\\'d, and spake: \"Nessus is this,\\nWho for the fair Deianira died,\\nAnd wrought himself revenge for his own fate.\\nHe in the midst, that on his breast looks down,\\nIs the great Chiron who Achilles nurs\\'d;\\nThat other Pholus, prone to wrath.\"  Around\\nThe foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts\\nAt whatsoever spirit dares emerge\\nFrom out the blood, more than his guilt allows.\\n\\nWe to those beasts, that rapid strode along,\\nDrew near, when Chiron took an arrow forth,\\nAnd with the notch push\\'d back his shaggy beard\\nTo the cheek-bone, then his great mouth to view\\nExposing, to his fellows thus exclaim\\'d:\\n\"Are ye aware, that he who comes behind\\nMoves what he touches?  The feet of the dead\\nAre not so wont.\"  My trusty guide, who now\\nStood near his breast, where the two natures join,\\nThus made reply: \"He is indeed alive,\\nAnd solitary so must needs by me\\nBe shown the gloomy vale, thereto induc\\'d\\nBy strict necessity, not by delight.\\nShe left her joyful harpings in the sky,\\nWho this new office to my care consign\\'d.\\nHe is no robber, no dark spirit I.\\nBut by that virtue, which empowers my step\\nTo treat so wild a path, grant us, I pray,\\nOne of thy band, whom we may trust secure,\\nWho to the ford may lead us, and convey\\nAcross, him mounted on his back; for he\\nIs not a spirit that may walk the air.\"\\n\\nThen on his right breast turning, Chiron thus\\nTo Nessus spake: \"Return, and be their guide.\\nAnd if ye chance to cross another troop,\\nCommand them keep aloof.\"  Onward we mov\\'d,\\nThe faithful escort by our side, along\\nThe border of the crimson-seething flood,\\nWhence from those steep\\'d within loud shrieks arose.\\n\\nSome there I mark\\'d, as high as to their brow\\nImmers\\'d, of whom the mighty Centaur thus:\\n\"These are the souls of tyrants, who were given\\nTo blood and rapine.  Here they wail aloud\\nTheir merciless wrongs.  Here Alexander dwells,\\nAnd Dionysius fell, who many a year\\nOf woe wrought for fair Sicily.  That brow\\nWhereon the hair so jetty clust\\'ring hangs,\\nIs Azzolino; that with flaxen locks\\nObizzo\\' of Este, in the world destroy\\'d\\nBy his foul step-son.\"  To the bard rever\\'d\\nI turned me round, and thus he spake; \"Let him\\nBe to thee now first leader, me but next\\nTo him in rank.\"  Then farther on a space\\nThe Centaur paus\\'d, near some, who at the throat\\nWere extant from the wave; and showing us\\nA spirit by itself apart retir\\'d,\\nExclaim\\'d: \"He in God\\'s bosom smote the heart,\\nWhich yet is honour\\'d on the bank of Thames.\"\\n\\nA race I next espied, who held the head,\\nAnd even all the bust above the stream.\\n\\'Midst these I many a face remember\\'d well.\\nThus shallow more and more the blood became,\\nSo that at last it but imbru\\'d the feet;\\nAnd there our passage lay athwart the foss.\\n\\n\"As ever on this side the boiling wave\\nThou seest diminishing,\" the Centaur said,\\n\"So on the other, be thou well assur\\'d,\\nIt lower still and lower sinks its bed,\\nTill in that part it reuniting join,\\nWhere \\'t is the lot of tyranny to mourn.\\nThere Heav\\'n\\'s stern justice lays chastising hand\\nOn Attila, who was the scourge of earth,\\nOn Sextus, and on Pyrrhus, and extracts\\nTears ever by the seething flood unlock\\'d\\nFrom the Rinieri, of Corneto this,\\nPazzo the other nam\\'d, who fill\\'d the ways\\nWith violence and war.\"  This said, he turn\\'d,\\nAnd quitting us, alone repass\\'d the ford.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XIII\\n\\nERE Nessus yet had reach\\'d the other bank,\\nWe enter\\'d on a forest, where no track\\nOf steps had worn a way.  Not verdant there\\nThe foliage, but of dusky hue; not light\\nThe boughs and tapering, but with knares deform\\'d\\nAnd matted thick: fruits there were none, but thorns\\nInstead, with venom fill\\'d. Less sharp than these,\\nLess intricate the brakes, wherein abide\\nThose animals, that hate the cultur\\'d fields,\\nBetwixt Corneto and Cecina\\'s stream.\\n\\nHere the brute Harpies make their nest, the same\\nWho from the Strophades the Trojan band\\nDrove with dire boding of their future woe.\\nBroad are their pennons, of the human form\\nTheir neck and count\\'nance, arm\\'d with talons keen\\nThe feet, and the huge belly fledge with wings\\nThese sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.\\n\\nThe kind instructor in these words began:\\n\"Ere farther thou proceed, know thou art now\\nI\\' th\\' second round, and shalt be, till thou come\\nUpon the horrid sand: look therefore well\\nAround thee, and such things thou shalt behold,\\nAs would my speech discredit.\"  On all sides\\nI heard sad plainings breathe, and none could see\\nFrom whom they might have issu\\'d.  In amaze\\nFast bound I stood.  He, as it seem\\'d, believ\\'d,\\nThat I had thought so many voices came\\nFrom some amid those thickets close conceal\\'d,\\nAnd thus his speech resum\\'d: \"If thou lop off\\nA single twig from one of those ill plants,\\nThe thought thou hast conceiv\\'d shall vanish quite.\"\\n\\nThereat a little stretching forth my hand,\\nFrom a great wilding gather\\'d I a branch,\\nAnd straight the trunk exclaim\\'d: \"Why pluck\\'st thou me?\"\\n\\nThen as the dark blood trickled down its side,\\nThese words it added: \"Wherefore tear\\'st me thus?\\nIs there no touch of mercy in thy breast?\\nMen once were we, that now are rooted here.\\nThy hand might well have spar\\'d us, had we been\\nThe souls of serpents.\"  As a brand yet green,\\nThat burning at one end from the\\' other sends\\nA groaning sound, and hisses with the wind\\nThat forces out its way, so burst at once,\\nForth from the broken splinter words and blood.\\n\\nI, letting fall the bough, remain\\'d as one\\nAssail\\'d by terror, and the sage replied:\\n\"If he, O injur\\'d spirit! could have believ\\'d\\nWhat he hath seen but in my verse describ\\'d,\\nHe never against thee had stretch\\'d his hand.\\nBut I, because the thing surpass\\'d belief,\\nPrompted him to this deed, which even now\\nMyself I rue.  But tell me, who thou wast;\\nThat, for this wrong to do thee some amends,\\nIn the upper world (for thither to return\\nIs granted him) thy fame he may revive.\"\\n\\n\"That pleasant word of thine,\" the trunk replied\\n\"Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech\\nCannot refrain, wherein if I indulge\\nA little longer, in the snare detain\\'d,\\nCount it not grievous.  I it was, who held\\nBoth keys to Frederick\\'s heart, and turn\\'d the wards,\\nOpening and shutting, with a skill so sweet,\\nThat besides me, into his inmost breast\\nScarce any other could admittance find.\\nThe faith I bore to my high charge was such,\\nIt cost me the life-blood that warm\\'d my veins.\\nThe harlot, who ne\\'er turn\\'d her gloating eyes\\nFrom Caesar\\'s household, common vice and pest\\nOf courts, \\'gainst me inflam\\'d the minds of all;\\nAnd to Augustus they so spread the flame,\\nThat my glad honours chang\\'d to bitter woes.\\nMy soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought\\nRefuge in death from scorn, and I became,\\nJust as I was, unjust toward myself.\\nBy the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear,\\nThat never faith I broke to my liege lord,\\nWho merited such honour; and of you,\\nIf any to the world indeed return,\\nClear he from wrong my memory, that lies\\nYet prostrate under envy\\'s cruel blow.\"\\n\\nFirst somewhat pausing, till the mournful words\\nWere ended, then to me the bard began:\\n\"Lose not the time; but speak and of him ask,\\nIf more thou wish to learn.\"  Whence I replied:\\n\"Question thou him again of whatsoe\\'er\\nWill, as thou think\\'st, content me; for no power\\nHave I to ask, such pity\\' is at my heart.\"\\n\\nHe thus resum\\'d; \"So may he do for thee\\nFreely what thou entreatest, as thou yet\\nBe pleas\\'d, imprison\\'d Spirit! to declare,\\nHow in these gnarled joints the soul is tied;\\nAnd whether any ever from such frame\\nBe loosen\\'d, if thou canst, that also tell.\"\\n\\nThereat the trunk breath\\'d hard, and the wind soon\\nChang\\'d into sounds articulate like these;\\n\\n\"Briefly ye shall be answer\\'d.  When departs\\nThe fierce soul from the body, by itself\\nThence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf\\nBy Minos doom\\'d, into the wood it falls,\\nNo place assign\\'d, but wheresoever chance\\nHurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt,\\nIt rises to a sapling, growing thence\\nA savage plant.  The Harpies, on its leaves\\nThen feeding, cause both pain and for the pain\\nA vent to grief.  We, as the rest, shall come\\nFor our own spoils, yet not so that with them\\nWe may again be clad; for what a man\\nTakes from himself it is not just he have.\\nHere we perforce shall drag them; and throughout\\nThe dismal glade our bodies shall be hung,\\nEach on the wild thorn of his wretched shade.\"\\n\\nAttentive yet to listen to the trunk\\nWe stood, expecting farther speech, when us\\nA noise surpris\\'d, as when a man perceives\\nThe wild boar and the hunt approach his place\\nOf station\\'d watch, who of the beasts and boughs\\nLoud rustling round him hears.  And lo! there came\\nTwo naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight,\\nThat they before them broke each fan o\\' th\\' wood.\\n\"Haste now,\" the foremost cried, \"now haste thee death!\"\\n\\nThe\\' other, as seem\\'d, impatient of delay\\nExclaiming, \"Lano! not so bent for speed\\nThy sinews, in the lists of Toppo\\'s field.\"\\nAnd then, for that perchance no longer breath\\nSuffic\\'d him, of himself and of a bush\\nOne group he made.  Behind them was the wood\\nFull of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,\\nAs greyhounds that have newly slipp\\'d the leash.\\nOn him, who squatted down, they stuck their fangs,\\nAnd having rent him piecemeal bore away\\nThe tortur\\'d limbs.  My guide then seiz\\'d my hand,\\nAnd led me to the thicket, which in vain\\nMourn\\'d through its bleeding wounds: \"O Giacomo\\nOf Sant\\' Andrea! what avails it thee,\"\\nIt cried, \"that of me thou hast made thy screen?\\nFor thy ill life what blame on me recoils?\"\\n\\nWhen o\\'er it he had paus\\'d, my master spake:\\n\"Say who wast thou, that at so many points\\nBreath\\'st out with blood thy lamentable speech?\"\\n\\nHe answer\\'d: \"Oh, ye spirits: arriv\\'d in time\\nTo spy the shameful havoc, that from me\\nMy leaves hath sever\\'d thus, gather them up,\\nAnd at the foot of their sad parent-tree\\nCarefully lay them.  In that city\\' I dwelt,\\nWho for the Baptist her first patron chang\\'d,\\nWhence he for this shall cease not with his art\\nTo work her woe: and if there still remain\\'d not\\nOn Arno\\'s passage some faint glimpse of him,\\nThose citizens, who rear\\'d once more her walls\\nUpon the ashes left by Attila,\\nHad labour\\'d without profit of their toil.\\nI slung the fatal noose from my own roof.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XIV\\n\\nSOON as the charity of native land\\nWrought in my bosom, I the scatter\\'d leaves\\nCollected, and to him restor\\'d, who now\\nWas hoarse with utt\\'rance.  To the limit thence\\nWe came, which from the third the second round\\nDivides, and where of justice is display\\'d\\nContrivance horrible.  Things then first seen\\nClearlier to manifest, I tell how next\\nA plain we reach\\'d, that from its sterile bed\\nEach plant repell\\'d. The mournful wood waves round\\nIts garland on all sides, as round the wood\\nSpreads the sad foss.  There, on the very edge,\\nOur steps we stay\\'d.  It was an area wide\\nOf arid sand and thick, resembling most\\nThe soil that erst by Cato\\'s foot was trod.\\n\\nVengeance of Heav\\'n!  Oh! how shouldst thou be fear\\'d\\nBy all, who read what here my eyes beheld!\\n\\nOf naked spirits many a flock I saw,\\nAll weeping piteously, to different laws\\nSubjected: for on the\\' earth some lay supine,\\nSome crouching close were seated, others pac\\'d\\nIncessantly around; the latter tribe,\\nMore numerous, those fewer who beneath\\nThe torment lay, but louder in their grief.\\n\\nO\\'er all the sand fell slowly wafting down\\nDilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow\\nOn Alpine summit, when the wind is hush\\'d.\\nAs in the torrid Indian clime, the son\\nOf Ammon saw upon his warrior band\\nDescending, solid flames, that to the ground\\nCame down: whence he bethought him with his troop\\nTo trample on the soil; for easier thus\\nThe vapour was extinguish\\'d, while alone;\\nSo fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith\\nThe marble glow\\'d underneath, as under stove\\nThe viands, doubly to augment the pain.\\n\\nUnceasing was the play of wretched hands,\\nNow this, now that way glancing, to shake off\\nThe heat, still falling fresh.  I thus began:\\n\"Instructor! thou who all things overcom\\'st,\\nExcept the hardy demons, that rush\\'d forth\\nTo stop our entrance at the gate, say who\\nIs yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not\\nThe burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn,\\nAs by the sultry tempest immatur\\'d?\"\\n\\nStraight he himself, who was aware I ask\\'d\\nMy guide of him, exclaim\\'d: \"Such as I was\\nWhen living, dead such now I am.  If Jove\\nWeary his workman out, from whom in ire\\nHe snatch\\'d the lightnings, that at my last day\\nTransfix\\'d me, if the rest be weary out\\nAt their black smithy labouring by turns\\nIn Mongibello, while he cries aloud;\\n\"Help, help, good Mulciber!\" as erst he cried\\nIn the Phlegraean warfare, and the bolts\\nLaunch he full aim\\'d at me with all his might,\\nHe never should enjoy a sweet revenge.\"\\n\\nThen thus my guide, in accent higher rais\\'d\\nThan I before had heard him: \"Capaneus!\\nThou art more punish\\'d, in that this thy pride\\nLives yet unquench\\'d: no torrent, save thy rage,\\nWere to thy fury pain proportion\\'d full.\"\\n\\nNext turning round to me with milder lip\\nHe spake: \"This of the seven kings was one,\\nWho girt the Theban walls with siege, and held,\\nAs still he seems to hold, God in disdain,\\nAnd sets his high omnipotence at nought.\\nBut, as I told him, his despiteful mood\\nIs ornament well suits the breast that wears it.\\nFollow me now; and look thou set not yet\\nThy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood\\nKeep ever close.\"  Silently on we pass\\'d\\nTo where there gushes from the forest\\'s bound\\nA little brook, whose crimson\\'d wave yet lifts\\nMy hair with horror.  As the rill, that runs\\nFrom Bulicame, to be portion\\'d out\\nAmong the sinful women; so ran this\\nDown through the sand, its bottom and each bank\\nStone-built, and either margin at its side,\\nWhereon I straight perceiv\\'d our passage lay.\\n\\n\"Of all that I have shown thee, since that gate\\nWe enter\\'d first, whose threshold is to none\\nDenied, nought else so worthy of regard,\\nAs is this river, has thine eye discern\\'d,\\nO\\'er which the flaming volley all is quench\\'d.\"\\n\\nSo spake my guide; and I him thence besought,\\nThat having giv\\'n me appetite to know,\\nThe food he too would give, that hunger crav\\'d.\\n\\n\"In midst of ocean,\" forthwith he began,\\n\"A desolate country lies, which Crete is nam\\'d,\\nUnder whose monarch in old times the world\\nLiv\\'d pure and chaste.  A mountain rises there,\\nCall\\'d Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams,\\nDeserted now like a forbidden thing.\\nIt was the spot which Rhea, Saturn\\'s spouse,\\nChose for the secret cradle of her son;\\nAnd better to conceal him, drown\\'d in shouts\\nHis infant cries.  Within the mount, upright\\nAn ancient form there stands and huge, that turns\\nHis shoulders towards Damiata, and at Rome\\nAs in his mirror looks.  Of finest gold\\nHis head is shap\\'d, pure silver are the breast\\nAnd arms; thence to the middle is of brass.\\nAnd downward all beneath well-temper\\'d steel,\\nSave the right foot of potter\\'s clay, on which\\nThan on the other more erect he stands,\\nEach part except the gold, is rent throughout;\\nAnd from the fissure tears distil, which join\\'d\\nPenetrate to that cave.  They in their course\\nThus far precipitated down the rock\\nForm Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon;\\nThen by this straiten\\'d channel passing hence\\nBeneath, e\\'en to the lowest depth of all,\\nForm there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself\\nShall see it) I here give thee no account.\"\\n\\nThen I to him: \"If from our world this sluice\\nBe thus deriv\\'d; wherefore to us but now\\nAppears it at this edge?\"  He straight replied:\\n\"The place, thou know\\'st, is round; and though great part\\nThou have already pass\\'d, still to the left\\nDescending to the nethermost, not yet\\nHast thou the circuit made of the whole orb.\\nWherefore if aught of new to us appear,\\nIt needs not bring up wonder in thy looks.\"\\n\\nThen I again inquir\\'d: \"Where flow the streams\\nOf Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one\\nThou tell\\'st not, and the other of that shower,\\nThou say\\'st, is form\\'d.\"  He answer thus return\\'d:\\n\"Doubtless thy questions all well pleas\\'d I hear.\\nYet the red seething wave might have resolv\\'d\\nOne thou proposest.  Lethe thou shalt see,\\nBut not within this hollow, in the place,\\nWhither to lave themselves the spirits go,\\nWhose blame hath been by penitence remov\\'d.\"\\nHe added: \"Time is now we quit the wood.\\nLook thou my steps pursue: the margins give\\nSafe passage, unimpeded by the flames;\\nFor over them all vapour is extinct.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XV\\n\\nOne of the solid margins bears us now\\nEnvelop\\'d in the mist, that from the stream\\nArising, hovers o\\'er, and saves from fire\\nBoth piers and water.  As the Flemings rear\\nTheir mound, \\'twixt Ghent and Bruges, to chase back\\nThe ocean, fearing his tumultuous tide\\nThat drives toward them, or the Paduans theirs\\nAlong the Brenta, to defend their towns\\nAnd castles, ere the genial warmth be felt\\nOn Chiarentana\\'s top; such were the mounds,\\nSo fram\\'d, though not in height or bulk to these\\nMade equal, by the master, whosoe\\'er\\nHe was, that rais\\'d them here.  We from the wood\\nWere not so far remov\\'d, that turning round\\nI might not have discern\\'d it, when we met\\nA troop of spirits, who came beside the pier.\\n\\nThey each one ey\\'d us, as at eventide\\nOne eyes another under a new moon,\\nAnd toward us sharpen\\'d their sight as keen,\\nAs an old tailor at his needle\\'s eye.\\n\\nThus narrowly explor\\'d by all the tribe,\\nI was agniz\\'d of one, who by the skirt\\nCaught me, and cried, \"What wonder have we here!\"\\n\\nAnd I, when he to me outstretch\\'d his arm,\\nIntently fix\\'d my ken on his parch\\'d looks,\\nThat although smirch\\'d with fire, they hinder\\'d not\\nBut I remember\\'d him; and towards his face\\nMy hand inclining, answer\\'d: \"Sir!  Brunetto!\\n\\n\"And art thou here?\"  He thus to me: \"My son!\\nOh let it not displease thee, if Brunetto\\nLatini but a little space with thee\\nTurn back, and leave his fellows to proceed.\"\\n\\nI thus to him replied: \"Much as I can,\\nI thereto pray thee; and if thou be willing,\\nThat I here seat me with thee, I consent;\\nHis leave, with whom I journey, first obtain\\'d.\"\\n\\n\"O son!\" said he, \"whoever of this throng\\nOne instant stops, lies then a hundred years,\\nNo fan to ventilate him, when the fire\\nSmites sorest.  Pass thou therefore on.  I close\\nWill at thy garments walk, and then rejoin\\nMy troop, who go mourning their endless doom.\"\\n\\nI dar\\'d not from the path descend to tread\\nOn equal ground with him, but held my head\\nBent down, as one who walks in reverent guise.\\n\\n\"What chance or destiny,\" thus he began,\\n\"Ere the last day conducts thee here below?\\nAnd who is this, that shows to thee the way?\"\\n\\n\"There up aloft,\" I answer\\'d, \"in the life\\nSerene, I wander\\'d in a valley lost,\\nBefore mine age had to its fullness reach\\'d.\\nBut yester-morn I left it: then once more\\nInto that vale returning, him I met;\\nAnd by this path homeward he leads me back.\"\\n\\n\"If thou,\" he answer\\'d, \"follow but thy star,\\nThou canst not miss at last a glorious haven:\\nUnless in fairer days my judgment err\\'d.\\nAnd if my fate so early had not chanc\\'d,\\nSeeing the heav\\'ns thus bounteous to thee, I\\nHad gladly giv\\'n thee comfort in thy work.\\nBut that ungrateful and malignant race,\\nWho in old times came down from Fesole,\\nAy and still smack of their rough mountain-flint,\\nWill for thy good deeds shew thee enmity.\\nNor wonder; for amongst ill-savour\\'d crabs\\nIt suits not the sweet fig-tree lay her fruit.\\nOld fame reports them in the world for blind,\\nCovetous, envious, proud.

They towards us came,\\nAnd each one cried aloud, \"Oh do thou stay!\\nWhom by the fashion of thy garb we deem\\nTo be some inmate of our evil land.\"\\n\\nAh me! what wounds I mark\\'d upon their limbs,\\nRecent and old, inflicted by the flames!\\nE\\'en the remembrance of them grieves me yet.\\n\\nAttentive to their cry my teacher paus\\'d,\\nAnd turn\\'d to me his visage, and then spake;\\n\"Wait now! our courtesy these merit well:\\nAnd were \\'t not for the nature of the place,\\nWhence glide the fiery darts, I should have said,\\nThat haste had better suited thee than them.\"\\n\\nThey, when we stopp\\'d, resum\\'d their ancient wail,\\nAnd soon as they had reach\\'d us, all the three\\nWhirl\\'d round together in one restless wheel.\\nAs naked champions, smear\\'d with slippery oil,\\nAre wont intent to watch their place of hold\\nAnd vantage, ere in closer strife they meet;\\nThus each one, as he wheel\\'d, his countenance\\nAt me directed, so that opposite\\nThe neck mov\\'d ever to the twinkling feet.\\n\\n\"If misery of this drear wilderness,\"\\nThus one began, \"added to our sad cheer\\nAnd destitute, do call forth scorn on us\\nAnd our entreaties, let our great renown\\nIncline thee to inform us who thou art,\\nThat dost imprint with living feet unharm\\'d\\nThe soil of Hell.

I follow\\'d; and small space\\nHad we pass\\'d onward, when the water\\'s sound\\nWas now so near at hand, that we had scarce\\nHeard one another\\'s speech for the loud din.\\n\\nE\\'en as the river, that holds on its course\\nUnmingled, from the mount of Vesulo,\\nOn the left side of Apennine, toward\\nThe east, which Acquacheta higher up\\nThey call, ere it descend into the vale,\\nAt Forli by that name no longer known,\\nRebellows o\\'er Saint Benedict, roll\\'d on\\nFrom the\\' Alpine summit down a precipice,\\nWhere space enough to lodge a thousand spreads;\\nThus downward from a craggy steep we found,\\nThat this dark wave resounded, roaring loud,\\nSo that the ear its clamour soon had stunn\\'d.\\n\\nI had a cord that brac\\'d my girdle round,\\nWherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take\\nThe painted leopard.  This when I had all\\nUnloosen\\'d from me (so my master bade)\\nI gather\\'d up, and stretch\\'d it forth to him.\\nThen to the right he turn\\'d, and from the brink\\nStanding few paces distant, cast it down\\nInto the deep abyss.  \"And somewhat strange,\"\\nThus to myself I spake, \"signal so strange\\nBetokens, which my guide with earnest eye\\nThus follows.\"  Ah! what caution must men use\\nWith those who look not at the deed alone,\\nBut spy into the thoughts with subtle skill!\\n\\n\"Quickly shall come,\" he said, \"what I expect,\\nThine eye discover quickly, that whereof\\nThy thought is dreaming.\"  Ever to that truth,\\nWhich but the semblance of a falsehood wears,\\nA man, if possible, should bar his lip;\\nSince, although blameless, he incurs reproach.\\nBut silence here were vain; and by these notes\\nWhich now I sing, reader!  I swear to thee,\\nSo may they favour find to latest times!\\nThat through the gross and murky air I spied\\nA shape come swimming up, that might have quell\\'d\\nThe stoutest heart with wonder, in such guise\\nAs one returns, who hath been down to loose\\nAn anchor grappled fast against some rock,\\nOr to aught else that in the salt wave lies,\\nWho upward springing close draws in his feet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XVII\\n\\n\"LO! the fell monster with the deadly sting!\\nWho passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls\\nAnd firm embattled spears, and with his filth\\nTaints all the world!\"  Thus me my guide address\\'d,\\nAnd beckon\\'d him, that he should come to shore,\\nNear to the stony causeway\\'s utmost edge.\\n\\nForthwith that image vile of fraud appear\\'d,\\nHis head and upper part expos\\'d on land,\\nBut laid not on the shore his bestial train.\\nHis face the semblance of a just man\\'s wore,\\nSo kind and gracious was its outward cheer;\\nThe rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws\\nReach\\'d to the armpits, and the back and breast,\\nAnd either side, were painted o\\'er with nodes\\nAnd orbits.  Colours variegated more\\nNor Turks nor Tartars e\\'er on cloth of state\\nWith interchangeable embroidery wove,\\nNor spread Arachne o\\'er her curious loom.\\nAs ofttimes a light skiff, moor\\'d to the shore,\\nStands part in water, part upon the land;\\nOr, as where dwells the greedy German boor,\\nThe beaver settles watching for his prey;\\nSo on the rim, that fenc\\'d the sand with rock,\\nSat perch\\'d the fiend of evil.  In the void\\nGlancing, his tail upturn\\'d its venomous fork,\\nWith sting like scorpion\\'s arm\\'d.  Then thus my guide:\\n\"Now need our way must turn few steps apart,\\nFar as to that ill beast, who couches there.\"\\n\\nThereat toward the right our downward course\\nWe shap\\'d, and, better to escape the flame\\nAnd burning marle, ten paces on the verge\\nProceeded.  Soon as we to him arrive,\\nA little further on mine eye beholds\\nA tribe of spirits, seated on the sand\\nNear the wide chasm.  Forthwith my master spake:\\n\"That to the full thy knowledge may extend\\nOf all this round contains, go now, and mark\\nThe mien these wear: but hold not long discourse.\\nTill thou returnest, I with him meantime\\nWill parley, that to us he may vouchsafe\\nThe aid of his strong shoulders.\"  Thus alone\\nYet forward on the\\' extremity I pac\\'d\\nOf that seventh circle, where the mournful tribe\\nWere seated.  At the eyes forth gush\\'d their pangs.\\nAgainst the vapours and the torrid soil\\nAlternately their shifting hands they plied.\\nThus use the dogs in summer still to ply\\nTheir jaws and feet by turns, when bitten sore\\nBy gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round.\\n\\nNoting the visages of some, who lay\\nBeneath the pelting of that dolorous fire,\\nOne of them all I knew not; but perceiv\\'d,\\nThat pendent from his neck each bore a pouch\\nWith colours and with emblems various mark\\'d,\\nOn which it seem\\'d as if their eye did feed.\\n\\nAnd when amongst them looking round I came,\\nA yellow purse I saw with azure wrought,\\nThat wore a lion\\'s countenance and port.\\nThen still my sight pursuing its career,\\nAnother I beheld, than blood more red.\\nA goose display of whiter wing than curd.\\nAnd one, who bore a fat and azure swine\\nPictur\\'d on his white scrip, addressed me thus:\\n\"What dost thou in this deep?  Go now and know,\\nSince yet thou livest, that my neighbour here\\nVitaliano on my left shall sit.\\nA Paduan with these Florentines am I.\\nOfttimes they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming\\n\\'O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch\\nWith the three beaks will bring!\\'\"  This said, he writh\\'d\\nThe mouth, and loll\\'d the tongue out, like an ox\\nThat licks his nostrils.  I, lest longer stay\\nHe ill might brook, who bade me stay not long,\\nBackward my steps from those sad spirits turn\\'d.\\n\\nMy guide already seated on the haunch\\nOf the fierce animal I found; and thus\\nHe me encourag\\'d.  \"Be thou stout; be bold.\\nDown such a steep flight must we now descend!\\nMount thou before: for that no power the tail\\nMay have to harm thee, I will be i\\' th\\' midst.\"\\n\\nAs one, who hath an ague fit so near,\\nHis nails already are turn\\'d blue, and he\\nQuivers all o\\'er, if he but eye the shade;\\nSuch was my cheer at hearing of his words.\\nBut shame soon interpos\\'d her threat, who makes\\nThe servant bold in presence of his lord.\\n\\nI settled me upon those shoulders huge,\\nAnd would have said, but that the words to aid\\nMy purpose came not, \"Look thou clasp me firm!\"\\n\\nBut he whose succour then not first I prov\\'d,\\nSoon as I mounted, in his arms aloft,\\nEmbracing, held me up, and thus he spake:\\n\"Geryon! now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres\\nOf ample circuit, easy thy descent.\\nThink on th\\' unusual burden thou sustain\\'st.\"\\n\\nAs a small vessel, back\\'ning out from land,\\nHer station quits; so thence the monster loos\\'d,\\nAnd when he felt himself at large, turn\\'d round\\nThere where the breast had been, his forked tail.\\nThus, like an eel, outstretch\\'d at length he steer\\'d,\\nGath\\'ring the air up with retractile claws.\\n\\nNot greater was the dread when Phaeton\\nThe reins let drop at random, whence high heaven,\\nWhereof signs yet appear, was wrapt in flames;\\nNor when ill-fated Icarus perceiv\\'d,\\nBy liquefaction of the scalded wax,\\nThe trusted pennons loosen\\'d from his loins,\\nHis sire exclaiming loud, \"Ill way thou keep\\'st!\"\\nThan was my dread, when round me on each part\\nThe air I view\\'d, and other object none\\nSave the fell beast.  He slowly sailing, wheels\\nHis downward motion, unobserv\\'d of me,\\nBut that the wind, arising to my face,\\nBreathes on me from below.  Now on our right\\nI heard the cataract beneath us leap\\nWith hideous crash; whence bending down to\\' explore,\\nNew terror I conceiv\\'d at the steep plunge:\\n\\nFor flames I saw, and wailings smote mine ear:\\nSo that all trembling close I crouch\\'d my limbs,\\nAnd then distinguish\\'d, unperceiv\\'d before,\\nBy the dread torments that on every side\\nDrew nearer, how our downward course we wound.\\n\\nAs falcon, that hath long been on the wing,\\nBut lure nor bird hath seen, while in despair\\nThe falconer cries, \"Ah me! thou stoop\\'st to earth!\"\\nWearied descends, and swiftly down the sky\\nIn many an orbit wheels, then lighting sits\\nAt distance from his lord in angry mood;\\nSo Geryon lighting places us on foot\\nLow down at base of the deep-furrow\\'d rock,\\nAnd, of his burden there discharg\\'d, forthwith\\nSprang forward, like an arrow from the string.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XVIII\\n\\nTHERE is a place within the depths of hell\\nCall\\'d Malebolge, all of rock dark-stain\\'d\\nWith hue ferruginous, e\\'en as the steep\\nThat round it circling winds.  Right in the midst\\nOf that abominable region, yawns\\nA spacious gulf profound, whereof the frame\\nDue time shall tell.  The circle, that remains,\\nThroughout its round, between the gulf and base\\nOf the high craggy banks, successive forms\\nTen trenches, in its hollow bottom sunk.\\n\\nAs where to guard the walls, full many a foss\\nBegirds some stately castle, sure defence\\nAffording to the space within, so here\\nWere model\\'d these; and as like fortresses\\nE\\'en from their threshold to the brink without,\\nAre flank\\'d with bridges; from the rock\\'s low base\\nThus flinty paths advanc\\'d, that \\'cross the moles\\nAnd dikes, struck onward far as to the gulf,\\nThat in one bound collected cuts them off.\\nSuch was the place, wherein we found ourselves\\nFrom Geryon\\'s back dislodg\\'d. The bard to left\\nHeld on his way, and I behind him mov\\'d.\\n\\nOn our right hand new misery I saw,\\nNew pains, new executioners of wrath,\\nThat swarming peopled the first chasm.  Below\\nWere naked sinners.  Hitherward they came,\\nMeeting our faces from the middle point,\\nWith us beyond but with a larger stride.\\nE\\'en thus the Romans, when the year returns\\nOf Jubilee, with better speed to rid\\nThe thronging multitudes, their means devise\\nFor such as pass the bridge; that on one side\\nAll front toward the castle, and approach\\nSaint Peter\\'s fane, on th\\' other towards the mount.\\n\\nEach divers way along the grisly rock,\\nHorn\\'d demons I beheld, with lashes huge,\\nThat on their back unmercifully smote.\\nAh! how they made them bound at the first stripe!\\n\\nNone for the second waited nor the third.\\n\\nMeantime as on I pass\\'d, one met my sight\\nWhom soon as view\\'d; \"Of him,\" cried I, \"not yet\\nMine eye hath had his fill.\"  With fixed gaze\\nI therefore scann\\'d him.  Straight the teacher kind\\nPaus\\'d with me, and consented I should walk\\nBackward a space, and the tormented spirit,\\nWho thought to hide him, bent his visage down.\\nBut it avail\\'d him nought; for I exclaim\\'d:\\n\"Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground,\\nUnless thy features do belie thee much,\\nVenedico art thou.  But what brings thee\\nInto this bitter seas\\'ning?\" He replied:\\n\"Unwillingly I answer to thy words.\\nBut thy clear speech, that to my mind recalls\\nThe world I once inhabited, constrains me.\\nKnow then \\'twas I who led fair Ghisola\\nTo do the Marquis\\' will, however fame\\nThe shameful tale have bruited.  Nor alone\\nBologna hither sendeth me to mourn\\nRather with us the place is so o\\'erthrong\\'d\\nThat not so many tongues this day are taught,\\nBetwixt the Reno and Savena\\'s stream,\\nTo answer SIPA in their country\\'s phrase.\\nAnd if of that securer proof thou need,\\nRemember but our craving thirst for gold.\"\\n\\nHim speaking thus, a demon with his thong\\nStruck, and exclaim\\'d, \"Away! corrupter! here\\nWomen are none for sale.\"  Forthwith I join\\'d\\nMy escort, and few paces thence we came\\nTo where a rock forth issued from the bank.\\nThat easily ascended, to the right\\nUpon its splinter turning, we depart\\nFrom those eternal barriers. When arriv\\'d,\\nWhere underneath the gaping arch lets pass\\nThe scourged souls: \"Pause here,\" the teacher said,\\n\"And let these others miserable, now\\nStrike on thy ken, faces not yet beheld,\\nFor that together they with us have walk\\'d.\"\\n\\nFrom the old bridge we ey\\'d the pack, who came\\nFrom th\\' other side towards us, like the rest,\\nExcoriate from the lash.  My gentle guide,\\nBy me unquestion\\'d, thus his speech resum\\'d:\\n\"Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends,\\nAnd seems too woe-begone to drop a tear.\\nHow yet the regal aspect he retains!\\nJason is he, whose skill and prowess won\\nThe ram from Colchos. To the Lemnian isle\\nHis passage thither led him, when those bold\\nAnd pitiless women had slain all their males.\\nThere he with tokens and fair witching words\\nHypsipyle beguil\\'d, a virgin young,\\nWho first had all the rest herself beguil\\'d.\\nImpregnated he left her there forlorn.\\nSuch is the guilt condemns him to this pain.\\nHere too Medea\\'s inj\\'ries are avenged.\\nAll bear him company, who like deceit\\nTo his have practis\\'d.  And thus much to know\\nOf the first vale suffice thee, and of those\\nWhom its keen torments urge.\"  Now had we come\\nWhere, crossing the next pier, the straighten\\'d path\\nBestrides its shoulders to another arch.\\n\\nHence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts,\\nWho jibber in low melancholy sounds,\\nWith wide-stretch\\'d nostrils snort, and on themselves\\nSmite with their palms.  Upon the banks a scurf\\nFrom the foul steam condens\\'d, encrusting hung,\\nThat held sharp combat with the sight and smell.\\n\\nSo hollow is the depth, that from no part,\\nSave on the summit of the rocky span,\\nCould I distinguish aught.  Thus far we came;\\nAnd thence I saw, within the foss below,\\nA crowd immers\\'d in ordure, that appear\\'d\\nDraff of the human body.  There beneath\\nSearching with eye inquisitive, I mark\\'d\\nOne with his head so grim\\'d, \\'t were hard to deem,\\nIf he were clerk or layman.  Loud he cried:\\n\"Why greedily thus bendest more on me,\\nThan on these other filthy ones, thy ken?\"\\n\\n\"Because if true my mem\\'ry,\" I replied,\\n\"I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks,\\nAnd thou Alessio art of Lucca sprung.\\nTherefore than all the rest I scan thee more.\"\\n\\nThen beating on his brain these words he spake:\\n\"Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk,\\nWherewith I ne\\'er enough could glut my tongue.\"\\n\\nMy leader thus: \"A little further stretch\\nThy face, that thou the visage well mayst note\\nOf that besotted, sluttish courtezan,\\nWho there doth rend her with defiled nails,\\nNow crouching down, now risen on her feet.\\n\\n\"Thais is this, the harlot, whose false lip\\nAnswer\\'d her doting paramour that ask\\'d,\\n\\'Thankest me much!\\'--\\'Say rather wondrously,\\'\\nAnd seeing this here satiate be our view.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XIX\\n\\nWOE to thee, Simon Magus! woe to you,\\nHis wretched followers! who the things of God,\\nWhich should be wedded unto goodness, them,\\nRapacious as ye are, do prostitute\\nFor gold and silver in adultery!\\nNow must the trumpet sound for you, since yours\\nIs the third chasm.  Upon the following vault\\nWe now had mounted, where the rock impends\\nDirectly o\\'er the centre of the foss.\\n\\nWisdom Supreme! how wonderful the art,\\nWhich thou dost manifest in heaven, in earth,\\nAnd in the evil world, how just a meed\\nAllotting by thy virtue unto all!\\n\\nI saw the livid stone, throughout the sides\\nAnd in its bottom full of apertures,\\nAll equal in their width, and circular each,\\nNor ample less nor larger they appear\\'d\\nThan in Saint John\\'s fair dome of me belov\\'d\\nThose fram\\'d to hold the pure baptismal streams,\\nOne of the which I brake, some few years past,\\nTo save a whelming infant; and be this\\nA seal to undeceive whoever doubts\\nThe motive of my deed.  From out the mouth\\nOf every one, emerg\\'d a sinner\\'s feet\\nAnd of the legs high upward as the calf\\nThe rest beneath was hid.  On either foot\\nThe soles were burning, whence the flexile joints\\nGlanc\\'d with such violent motion, as had snapt\\nAsunder cords or twisted withs.  As flame,\\nFeeding on unctuous matter, glides along\\nThe surface, scarcely touching where it moves;\\nSo here, from heel to point, glided the flames.\\n\\n\"Master! say who is he, than all the rest\\nGlancing in fiercer agony, on whom\\nA ruddier flame doth prey?\"  I thus inquir\\'d.\\n\\n\"If thou be willing,\" he replied, \"that I\\nCarry thee down, where least the slope bank falls,\\nHe of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs.\"\\n\\nI then: \"As pleases thee to me is best.\\nThou art my lord; and know\\'st that ne\\'er I quit\\nThy will: what silence hides that knowest thou.\"\\nThereat on the fourth pier we came, we turn\\'d,\\nAnd on our left descended to the depth,\\nA narrow strait and perforated close.\\nNor from his side my leader set me down,\\nTill to his orifice he brought, whose limb\\nQuiv\\'ring express\\'d his pang.  \"Whoe\\'er thou art,\\nSad spirit! thus revers\\'d, and as a stake\\nDriv\\'n in the soil!\"  I in these words began,\\n\"If thou be able, utter forth thy voice.\"\\n\\nThere stood I like the friar, that doth shrive\\nA wretch for murder doom\\'d, who e\\'en when fix\\'d,\\nCalleth him back, whence death awhile delays.\\n\\nHe shouted: \"Ha! already standest there?\\nAlready standest there, O Boniface!\\nBy many a year the writing play\\'d me false.\\nSo early dost thou surfeit with the wealth,\\nFor which thou fearedst not in guile to take\\nThe lovely lady, and then mangle her?\"\\n\\nI felt as those who, piercing not the drift\\nOf answer made them, stand as if expos\\'d\\nIn mockery, nor know what to reply,\\nWhen Virgil thus admonish\\'d: \"Tell him quick,\\nI am not he, not he, whom thou believ\\'st.\"\\n\\nAnd I, as was enjoin\\'d me, straight replied.\\n\\nThat heard, the spirit all did wrench his feet,\\nAnd sighing next in woeful accent spake:\\n\"What then of me requirest?  If to know\\nSo much imports thee, who I am, that thou\\nHast therefore down the bank descended, learn\\nThat in the mighty mantle I was rob\\'d,\\nAnd of a she-bear was indeed the son,\\nSo eager to advance my whelps, that there\\nMy having in my purse above I stow\\'d,\\nAnd here myself.  Under my head are dragg\\'d\\nThe rest, my predecessors in the guilt\\nOf simony.  Stretch\\'d at their length they lie\\nAlong an opening in the rock.  \\'Midst them\\nI also low shall fall, soon as he comes,\\nFor whom I took thee, when so hastily\\nI question\\'d.  But already longer time\\nHath pass\\'d, since my souls kindled, and I thus\\nUpturn\\'d have stood, than is his doom to stand\\nPlanted with fiery feet.  For after him,\\nOne yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive,\\nFrom forth the west, a shepherd without law,\\nFated to cover both his form and mine.\\nHe a new Jason shall be call\\'d, of whom\\nIn Maccabees we read; and favour such\\nAs to that priest his king indulgent show\\'d,\\nShall be of France\\'s monarch shown to him.\"\\n\\nI know not if I here too far presum\\'d,\\nBut in this strain I answer\\'d: \"Tell me now,\\nWhat treasures from St. Peter at the first\\nOur Lord demanded, when he put the keys\\nInto his charge?  Surely he ask\\'d no more\\nBut, Follow me!  Nor Peter nor the rest\\nOr gold or silver of Matthias took,\\nWhen lots were cast upon the forfeit place\\nOf the condemned soul.

I do believe\\nMy teacher well was pleas\\'d, with so compos\\'d\\nA lip, he listen\\'d ever to the sound\\nOf the true words I utter\\'d.  In both arms\\nHe caught, and to his bosom lifting me\\nUpward retrac\\'d the way of his descent.\\n\\nNor weary of his weight he press\\'d me close,\\nTill to the summit of the rock we came,\\nOur passage from the fourth to the fifth pier.\\nHis cherish\\'d burden there gently he plac\\'d\\nUpon the rugged rock and steep, a path\\nNot easy for the clamb\\'ring goat to mount.\\n\\nThence to my view another vale appear\\'d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XX\\n\\nAND now the verse proceeds to torments new,\\nFit argument of this the twentieth strain\\nOf the first song, whose awful theme records\\nThe spirits whelm\\'d in woe.  Earnest I look\\'d\\nInto the depth, that open\\'d to my view,\\nMoisten\\'d with tears of anguish, and beheld\\nA tribe, that came along the hollow vale,\\nIn silence weeping: such their step as walk\\nQuires chanting solemn litanies on earth.\\n\\nAs on them more direct mine eye descends,\\nEach wondrously seem\\'d to be revers\\'d\\nAt the neck-bone, so that the countenance\\nWas from the reins averted: and because\\nNone might before him look, they were compell\\'d\\nTo\\' advance with backward gait.  Thus one perhaps\\nHath been by force of palsy clean transpos\\'d,\\nBut I ne\\'er saw it nor believe it so.\\n\\nNow, reader! think within thyself, so God\\nFruit of thy reading give thee! how I long\\nCould keep my visage dry, when I beheld\\nNear me our form distorted in such guise,\\nThat on the hinder parts fall\\'n from the face\\nThe tears down-streaming roll\\'d.  Against a rock\\nI leant and wept, so that my guide exclaim\\'d:\\n\"What, and art thou too witless as the rest?\\nHere pity most doth show herself alive,\\nWhen she is dead.  What guilt exceedeth his,\\nWho with Heaven\\'s judgment in his passion strives?\\nRaise up thy head, raise up, and see the man,\\nBefore whose eyes earth gap\\'d in Thebes, when all\\nCried out, \\'Amphiaraus, whither rushest?\\n\\'Why leavest thou the war?\\'  He not the less\\nFell ruining far as to Minos down,\\nWhose grapple none eludes.

I that beheld,\\nBut therein nought distinguish\\'d, save the surge,\\nRais\\'d by the boiling, in one mighty swell\\nHeave, and by turns subsiding and fall.  While there\\nI fix\\'d my ken below, \"Mark! mark!\" my guide\\nExclaiming, drew me towards him from the place,\\nWherein I stood.  I turn\\'d myself as one,\\nImpatient to behold that which beheld\\nHe needs must shun, whom sudden fear unmans,\\nThat he his flight delays not for the view.\\nBehind me I discern\\'d a devil black,\\nThat running, up advanc\\'d along the rock.\\nAh! what fierce cruelty his look bespake!\\nIn act how bitter did he seem, with wings\\nBuoyant outstretch\\'d and feet of nimblest tread!\\nHis shoulder proudly eminent and sharp\\nWas with a sinner charg\\'d; by either haunch\\nHe held him, the foot\\'s sinew griping fast.\\n\\n\"Ye of our bridge!\" he cried, \"keen-talon\\'d fiends!\\nLo! one of Santa Zita\\'s elders!

He aloud:\\n\"Be none of you outrageous: ere your time\\nDare seize me, come forth from amongst you one,\\n\\n\"Who having heard my words, decide he then\\nIf he shall tear these limbs.\"  They shouted loud,\\n\"Go, Malacoda!\"  Whereat one advanc\\'d,\\nThe others standing firm, and as he came,\\n\"What may this turn avail him?\" he exclaim\\'d.\\n\\n\"Believ\\'st thou, Malacoda!  I had come\\nThus far from all your skirmishing secure,\"\\nMy teacher answered, \"without will divine\\nAnd destiny propitious?  Pass we then\\nFor so Heaven\\'s pleasure is, that I should lead\\nAnother through this savage wilderness.\"\\n\\nForthwith so fell his pride, that he let drop\\nThe instrument of torture at his feet,\\nAnd to the rest exclaim\\'d: \"We have no power\\nTo strike him.\"  Then to me my guide: \"O thou!\\nWho on the bridge among the crags dost sit\\nLow crouching, safely now to me return.\"\\n\\nI rose, and towards him moved with speed: the fiends\\nMeantime all forward drew: me terror seiz\\'d\\nLest they should break the compact they had made.\\nThus issuing from Caprona, once I saw\\nTh\\' infantry dreading, lest his covenant\\nThe foe should break; so close he hemm\\'d them round.\\n\\nI to my leader\\'s side adher\\'d, mine eyes\\nWith fixt and motionless observance bent\\nOn their unkindly visage.

As dolphins, that, in sign\\nTo mariners, heave high their arched backs,\\nThat thence forewarn\\'d they may advise to save\\nTheir threaten\\'d vessels; so, at intervals,\\nTo ease the pain his back some sinner show\\'d,\\nThen hid more nimbly than the lightning glance.\\n\\nE\\'en as the frogs, that of a wat\\'ry moat\\nStand at the brink, with the jaws only out,\\nTheir feet and of the trunk all else concealed,\\nThus on each part the sinners stood, but soon\\nAs Barbariccia was at hand, so they\\nDrew back under the wave.  I saw, and yet\\nMy heart doth stagger, one, that waited thus,\\nAs it befalls that oft one frog remains,\\nWhile the next springs away: and Graffiacan,\\nWho of the fiends was nearest, grappling seiz\\'d\\nHis clotted locks, and dragg\\'d him sprawling up,\\nThat he appear\\'d to me an otter.  Each\\nAlready by their names I knew, so well\\nWhen they were chosen, I observ\\'d, and mark\\'d\\nHow one the other call\\'d. \"O Rubicant!\\nSee that his hide thou with thy talons flay,\"\\nShouted together all the cursed crew.\\n\\nThen I: \"Inform thee, master! if thou may,\\nWhat wretched soul is this, on whom their hand\\nHis foes have laid.\"  My leader to his side\\nApproach\\'d, and whence he came inquir\\'d, to whom\\nWas answer\\'d thus: \"Born in Navarre\\'s domain\\nMy mother plac\\'d me in a lord\\'s retinue,\\nFor she had borne me to a losel vile,\\nA spendthrift of his substance and himself.\\nThe good king Thibault after that I serv\\'d,\\nTo peculating here my thoughts were turn\\'d,\\nWhereof I give account in this dire heat.\"\\n\\nStraight Ciriatto, from whose mouth a tusk\\nIssued on either side, as from a boar,\\nRipt him with one of these.  \\'Twixt evil claws\\nThe mouse had fall\\'n: but Barbariccia cried,\\nSeizing him with both arms: \"Stand thou apart,\\nWhile I do fix him on my prong transpierc\\'d.\"\\nThen added, turning to my guide his face,\\n\"Inquire of him, if more thou wish to learn,\\nEre he again be rent.\"  My leader thus:\\n\"Then tell us of the partners in thy guilt;\\nKnowest thou any sprung of Latian land\\nUnder the tar?\"--\"I parted,\" he replied,\\n\"But now from one, who sojourn\\'d not far thence;\\nSo were I under shelter now with him!\\nNor hook nor talon then should scare me more.\"--.\\n\\n\"Too long we suffer,\" Libicocco cried,\\nThen, darting forth a prong, seiz\\'d on his arm,\\nAnd mangled bore away the sinewy part.\\nHim Draghinazzo by his thighs beneath\\nWould next have caught, whence angrily their chief,\\nTurning on all sides round, with threat\\'ning brow\\nRestrain\\'d them.  When their strife a little ceas\\'d,\\nOf him, who yet was gazing on his wound,\\nMy teacher thus without delay inquir\\'d:\\n\"Who was the spirit, from whom by evil hap\\nParting, as thou has told, thou cam\\'st to shore?\"--\\n\\n\"It was the friar Gomita,\" he rejoin\\'d,\\n\"He of Gallura, vessel of all guile,\\nWho had his master\\'s enemies in hand,\\nAnd us\\'d them so that they commend him well.\\nMoney he took, and them at large dismiss\\'d.\\nSo he reports: and in each other charge\\nCommitted to his keeping, play\\'d the part\\nOf barterer to the height:  with him doth herd\\nThe chief of Logodoro, Michel Zanche.\\nSardinia is a theme, whereof their tongue\\nIs never weary.

That mockery\\nIn Calcabrina fury stirr\\'d, who flew\\nAfter him, with desire of strife inflam\\'d;\\nAnd, for the barterer had \\'scap\\'d, so turn\\'d\\nHis talons on his comrade.

If anger then\\nBe to their evil will conjoin\\'d, more fell\\nThey shall pursue us, than the savage hound\\nSnatches the leveret, panting \\'twixt his jaws.\"\\n\\nAlready I perceiv\\'d my hair stand all\\nOn end with terror, and look\\'d eager back.\\n\\n\"Teacher,\" I thus began, \"if speedily\\nThyself and me thou hide not, much I dread\\nThose evil talons.  Even now behind\\nThey urge us: quick imagination works\\nSo forcibly, that I already feel them.\"\\n\\nHe answer\\'d: \"Were I form\\'d of leaded glass,\\nI should not sooner draw unto myself\\nThy outward image, than I now imprint\\nThat from within.  This moment came thy thoughts\\nPresented before mine, with similar act\\nAnd count\\'nance similar, so that from both\\nI one design have fram\\'d.  If the right coast\\nIncline so much, that we may thence descend\\nInto the other chasm, we shall escape\\nSecure from this imagined pursuit.\"\\n\\nHe had not spoke his purpose to the end,\\nWhen I from far beheld them with spread wings\\nApproach to take us.  Suddenly my guide\\nCaught me, ev\\'n as a mother that from sleep\\nIs by the noise arous\\'d, and near her sees\\nThe climbing fires, who snatches up her babe\\nAnd flies ne\\'er pausing, careful more of him\\nThan of herself, that but a single vest\\nClings round her limbs.  Down from the jutting beach\\nSupine he cast him, to that pendent rock,\\nWhich closes on one part the other chasm.\\n\\nNever ran water with such hurrying pace\\nAdown the tube to turn a landmill\\'s wheel,\\nWhen nearest it approaches to the spokes,\\nAs then along that edge my master ran,\\nCarrying me in his bosom, as a child,\\nNot a companion.  Scarcely had his feet\\nReach\\'d to the lowest of the bed beneath,\\n\\nWhen over us the steep they reach\\'d; but fear\\nIn him was none; for that high Providence,\\nWhich plac\\'d them ministers of the fifth foss,\\nPower of departing thence took from them all.\\n\\nThere in the depth we saw a painted tribe,\\nWho pac\\'d with tardy steps around, and wept,\\nFaint in appearance and o\\'ercome with toil.\\nCaps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down\\nBefore their eyes, in fashion like to those\\nWorn by the monks in Cologne.  Their outside\\nWas overlaid with gold, dazzling to view,\\nBut leaden all within, and of such weight,\\nThat Frederick\\'s compar\\'d to these were straw.\\nOh, everlasting wearisome attire!\\n\\nWe yet once more with them together turn\\'d\\nTo leftward, on their dismal moan intent.\\nBut by the weight oppress\\'d, so slowly came\\nThe fainting people, that our company\\nWas chang\\'d at every movement of the step.\\n\\nWhence I my guide address\\'d: \"See that thou find\\nSome spirit, whose name may by his deeds be known,\\nAnd to that end look round thee as thou go\\'st.\"\\n\\nThen one, who understood the Tuscan voice,\\nCried after us aloud: \"Hold in your feet,\\nYe who so swiftly speed through the dusk air.\\nPerchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish.\"\\n\\nWhereat my leader, turning, me bespake:\\n\"Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed.\"\\n\\nI staid, and saw two Spirits in whose look\\nImpatient eagerness of mind was mark\\'d\\nTo overtake me; but the load they bare\\nAnd narrow path retarded their approach.\\n\\nSoon as arriv\\'d, they with an eye askance\\nPerus\\'d me, but spake not: then turning each\\nTo other thus conferring said: \"This one\\nSeems, by the action of his throat, alive.\\nAnd, be they dead, what privilege allows\\nThey walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?\"\\n\\nThen thus to me: \"Tuscan, who visitest\\nThe college of the mourning hypocrites,\\nDisdain not to instruct us who thou art.\"\\n\\n\"By Arno\\'s pleasant stream,\" I thus replied,\\n\"In the great city I was bred and grew,\\nAnd wear the body I have ever worn.\\nbut who are ye, from whom such mighty grief,\\nAs now I witness, courseth down your cheeks?\\nWhat torment breaks forth in this bitter woe?\"\\n\"Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue,\"\\nOne of them answer\\'d, \"are so leaden gross,\\nThat with their weight they make the balances\\nTo crack beneath them.  Joyous friars we were,\\nBologna\\'s natives, Catalano I,\\nHe Loderingo nam\\'d, and by thy land\\nTogether taken, as men used to take\\nA single and indifferent arbiter,\\nTo reconcile their strifes.  How there we sped,\\nGardingo\\'s vicinage can best declare.\"\\n\\n\"O friars!\"  I began, \"your miseries--\"\\nBut there brake off, for one had caught my eye,\\nFix\\'d to a cross with three stakes on the ground:\\nHe, when he saw me, writh\\'d himself, throughout\\nDistorted, ruffling with deep sighs his beard.\\nAnd Catalano, who thereof was \\'ware,\\n\\nThus spake: \"That pierced spirit, whom intent\\nThou view\\'st, was he who gave the Pharisees\\nCounsel, that it were fitting for one man\\nTo suffer for the people.  He doth lie\\nTransverse; nor any passes, but him first\\nBehoves make feeling trial how each weighs.\\nIn straits like this along the foss are plac\\'d\\nThe father of his consort, and the rest\\nPartakers in that council, seed of ill\\nAnd sorrow to the Jews.\"  I noted then,\\nHow Virgil gaz\\'d with wonder upon him,\\nThus abjectly extended on the cross\\nIn banishment eternal.  To the friar\\nHe next his words address\\'d: \"We pray ye tell,\\nIf so be lawful, whether on our right\\nLies any opening in the rock, whereby\\nWe both may issue hence, without constraint\\nOn the dark angels, that compell\\'d they come\\nTo lead us from this depth.\"  He thus replied:\\n\"Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock\\nFrom the next circle moving, which o\\'ersteps\\nEach vale of horror, save that here his cope\\nIs shatter\\'d.  By the ruin ye may mount:\\nFor on the side it slants, and most the height\\nRises below.\"  With head bent down awhile\\nMy leader stood, then spake: \"He warn\\'d us ill,\\nWho yonder hangs the sinners on his hook.\"\\n\\nTo whom the friar: At Bologna erst\\n\"I many vices of the devil heard,\\nAmong the rest was said, \\'He is a liar,\\nAnd the father of lies!\\'\"  When he had spoke,\\nMy leader with large strides proceeded on,\\nSomewhat disturb\\'d with anger in his look.\\n\\nI therefore left the spirits heavy laden,\\nAnd following, his beloved footsteps mark\\'d.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXIV\\n\\nIN the year\\'s early nonage, when the sun\\nTempers his tresses in Aquarius\\' urn,\\nAnd now towards equal day the nights recede,\\nWhen as the rime upon the earth puts on\\nHer dazzling sister\\'s image, but not long\\nHer milder sway endures, then riseth up\\nThe village hind, whom fails his wintry store,\\nAnd looking out beholds the plain around\\nAll whiten\\'d, whence impatiently he smites\\nHis thighs, and to his hut returning in,\\nThere paces to and fro, wailing his lot,\\nAs a discomfited and helpless man;\\nThen comes he forth again, and feels new hope\\nSpring in his bosom, finding e\\'en thus soon\\nThe world hath chang\\'d its count\\'nance, grasps his crook,\\nAnd forth to pasture drives his little flock:\\nSo me my guide dishearten\\'d when I saw\\nHis troubled forehead, and so speedily\\nThat ill was cur\\'d; for at the fallen bridge\\nArriving, towards me with a look as sweet,\\nHe turn\\'d him back, as that I first beheld\\nAt the steep mountain\\'s foot.  Regarding well\\nThe ruin, and some counsel first maintain\\'d\\nWith his own thought, he open\\'d wide his arm\\nAnd took me up.  As one, who, while he works,\\nComputes his labour\\'s issue, that he seems\\nStill to foresee the\\' effect, so lifting me\\nUp to the summit of one peak, he fix\\'d\\nHis eye upon another.  \"Grapple that,\"\\nSaid he, \"but first make proof, if it be such\\nAs will sustain thee.\"  For one capp\\'d with lead\\nThis were no journey.  Scarcely he, though light,\\nAnd I, though onward push\\'d from crag to crag,\\nCould mount.  And if the precinct of this coast\\nWere not less ample than the last, for him\\nI know not, but my strength had surely fail\\'d.\\nBut Malebolge all toward the mouth\\nInclining of the nethermost abyss,\\nThe site of every valley hence requires,\\nThat one side upward slope, the other fall.\\n\\nAt length the point of our descent we reach\\'d\\nFrom the last flag: soon as to that arriv\\'d,\\nSo was the breath exhausted from my lungs,\\nI could no further, but did seat me there.\\n\\n\"Now needs thy best of man;\" so spake my guide:\\n\"For not on downy plumes, nor under shade\\nOf canopy reposing, fame is won,\\nWithout which whosoe\\'er consumes his days\\nLeaveth such vestige of himself on earth,\\nAs smoke in air or foam upon the wave.\\nThou therefore rise: vanish thy weariness\\nBy the mind\\'s effort, in each struggle form\\'d\\nTo vanquish, if she suffer not the weight\\nOf her corporeal frame to crush her down.\\nA longer ladder yet remains to scale.\\nFrom these to have escap\\'d sufficeth not.\\nIf well thou note me, profit by my words.\"\\n\\nI straightway rose, and show\\'d myself less spent\\nThan I in truth did feel me.  \"On,\" I cried,\\n\"For I am stout and fearless.\"  Up the rock\\nOur way we held, more rugged than before,\\nNarrower and steeper far to climb.  From talk\\nI ceas\\'d not, as we journey\\'d, so to seem\\nLeast faint; whereat a voice from the other foss\\nDid issue forth, for utt\\'rance suited ill.\\nThough on the arch that crosses there I stood,\\nWhat were the words I knew not, but who spake\\nSeem\\'d mov\\'d in anger.  Down I stoop\\'d to look,\\nBut my quick eye might reach not to the depth\\nFor shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake:\\n\"To the next circle, Teacher, bend thy steps,\\nAnd from the wall dismount we; for as hence\\nI hear and understand not, so I see\\nBeneath, and naught discern.\"--\"I answer not,\"\\nSaid he, \"but by the deed.  To fair request\\nSilent performance maketh best return.\"\\n\\nWe from the bridge\\'s head descended, where\\nTo the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm\\nOpening to view, I saw a crowd within\\nOf serpents terrible, so strange of shape\\nAnd hideous, that remembrance in my veins\\nYet shrinks the vital current.  Of her sands\\nLet Lybia vaunt no more: if Jaculus,\\nPareas and Chelyder be her brood,\\nCenchris and Amphisboena, plagues so dire\\nOr in such numbers swarming ne\\'er she shew\\'d,\\nNot with all Ethiopia, and whate\\'er\\nAbove the Erythraean sea is spawn\\'d.\\n\\nAmid this dread exuberance of woe\\nRan naked spirits wing\\'d with horrid fear,\\nNor hope had they of crevice where to hide,\\nOr heliotrope to charm them out of view.\\nWith serpents were their hands behind them bound,\\nWhich through their reins infix\\'d the tail and head\\nTwisted in folds before.  And lo! on one\\nNear to our side, darted an adder up,\\nAnd, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,\\nTranspierc\\'d him.  Far more quickly than e\\'er pen\\nWrote O or I, he kindled, burn\\'d, and chang\\'d\\nTo ashes, all pour\\'d out upon the earth.\\nWhen there dissolv\\'d he lay, the dust again\\nUproll\\'d spontaneous, and the self-same form\\nInstant resumed.  So mighty sages tell,\\nThe\\' Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years\\nHave well nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith\\nRenascent.  Blade nor herb throughout his life\\nHe tastes, but tears of frankincense alone\\nAnd odorous amomum: swaths of nard\\nAnd myrrh his funeral shroud.  As one that falls,\\nHe knows not how, by force demoniac dragg\\'d\\nTo earth, or through obstruction fettering up\\nIn chains invisible the powers of man,\\nWho, risen from his trance, gazeth around,\\nBewilder\\'d with the monstrous agony\\nHe hath endur\\'d, and wildly staring sighs;\\nSo stood aghast the sinner when he rose.\\n\\nOh! how severe God\\'s judgment, that deals out\\nSuch blows in stormy vengeance!  Who he was\\nMy teacher next inquir\\'d, and thus in few\\nHe answer\\'d: \"Vanni Fucci am I call\\'d,\\nNot long since rained down from Tuscany\\nTo this dire gullet.  Me the beastial life\\nAnd not the human pleas\\'d, mule that I was,\\nWho in Pistoia found my worthy den.\"\\n\\nI then to Virgil: \"Bid him stir not hence,\\nAnd ask what crime did thrust him hither: once\\nA man I knew him choleric and bloody.\"\\n\\nThe sinner heard and feign\\'d not, but towards me\\nHis mind directing and his face, wherein\\nWas dismal shame depictur\\'d, thus he spake:\\n\"It grieves me more to have been caught by thee\\nIn this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than\\nWhen I was taken from the other life.\\nI have no power permitted to deny\\nWhat thou inquirest.  I am doom\\'d thus low\\nTo dwell, for that the sacristy by me\\nWas rifled of its goodly ornaments,\\nAnd with the guilt another falsely charged.\\nBut that thou mayst not joy to see me thus,\\nSo as thou e\\'er shalt \\'scape this darksome realm\\nOpen thine ears and hear what I forebode.\\nReft of the Neri first Pistoia pines,\\nThen Florence changeth citizens and laws.\\nFrom Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,\\nA vapour rises, wrapt in turbid mists,\\nAnd sharp and eager driveth on the storm\\nWith arrowy hurtling o\\'er Piceno\\'s field,\\nWhence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike\\nEach helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.\\nThis have I told, that grief may rend thy heart.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXV\\n\\nWHEN he had spoke, the sinner rais\\'d his hands\\nPointed in mockery, and cried: \"Take them, God!\\nI level them at thee!\"  From that day forth\\nThe serpents were my friends; for round his neck\\nOne of then rolling twisted, as it said,\\n\"Be silent, tongue!\"  Another to his arms\\nUpgliding, tied them, riveting itself\\nSo close, it took from them the power to move.\\n\\nPistoia!  Ah Pistoia! why dost doubt\\nTo turn thee into ashes, cumb\\'ring earth\\nNo longer, since in evil act so far\\nThou hast outdone thy seed?  I did not mark,\\nThrough all the gloomy circles of the\\' abyss,\\nSpirit, that swell\\'d so proudly \\'gainst his God,\\nNot him, who headlong fell from Thebes.  He fled,\\nNor utter\\'d more; and after him there came\\nA centaur full of fury, shouting, \"Where\\nWhere is the caitiff?\"  On Maremma\\'s marsh\\nSwarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch\\nThey swarm\\'d, to where the human face begins.\\nBehind his head upon the shoulders lay,\\nWith open wings, a dragon breathing fire\\nOn whomsoe\\'er he met.  To me my guide:\\n\"Cacus is this, who underneath the rock\\nOf Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.\\nHe, from his brethren parted, here must tread\\nA different journey, for his fraudful theft\\nOf the great herd, that near him stall\\'d; whence found\\nHis felon deeds their end, beneath the mace\\nOf stout Alcides, that perchance laid on\\nA hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt.\"\\n\\nWhile yet he spake, the centaur sped away:\\nAnd under us three spirits came, of whom\\nNor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim\\'d;\\n\"Say who are ye?\"  We then brake off discourse,\\nIntent on these alone.  I knew them not;\\nBut, as it chanceth oft, befell, that one\\nHad need to name another.  \"Where,\" said he,\\n\"Doth Cianfa lurk?\"  I, for a sign my guide\\nShould stand attentive, plac\\'d against my lips\\nThe finger lifted.  If, O reader! now\\nThou be not apt to credit what I tell,\\nNo marvel; for myself do scarce allow\\nThe witness of mine eyes.  But as I looked\\nToward them, lo! a serpent with six feet\\nSprings forth on one, and fastens full upon him:\\nHis midmost grasp\\'d the belly, a forefoot\\nSeiz\\'d on each arm (while deep in either cheek\\nHe flesh\\'d his fangs); the hinder on the thighs\\nWere spread, \\'twixt which the tail inserted curl\\'d\\nUpon the reins behind.  Ivy ne\\'er clasp\\'d\\nA dodder\\'d oak, as round the other\\'s limbs\\nThe hideous monster intertwin\\'d his own.\\nThen, as they both had been of burning wax,\\nEach melted into other, mingling hues,\\nThat which was either now was seen no more.\\nThus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,\\nA brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,\\nAnd the clean white expires.  The other two\\nLook\\'d on exclaiming: \"Ah, how dost thou change,\\nAgnello!  See!  Thou art nor double now,\\n\\n\"Nor only one.\"  The two heads now became\\nOne, and two figures blended in one form\\nAppear\\'d, where both were lost.  Of the four lengths\\nTwo arms were made: the belly and the chest\\nThe thighs and legs into such members chang\\'d,\\nAs never eye hath seen.  Of former shape\\nAll trace was vanish\\'d.  Two yet neither seem\\'d\\nThat image miscreate, and so pass\\'d on\\nWith tardy steps.  As underneath the scourge\\nOf the fierce dog-star, that lays bare the fields,\\nShifting from brake to brake, the lizard seems\\nA flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,\\nSo toward th\\' entrails of the other two\\nApproaching seem\\'d, an adder all on fire,\\nAs the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart.\\nIn that part, whence our life is nourish\\'d first,\\nOne he transpierc\\'d; then down before him fell\\nStretch\\'d out.  The pierced spirit look\\'d on him\\nBut spake not; yea stood motionless and yawn\\'d,\\nAs if by sleep or fev\\'rous fit assail\\'d.\\nHe ey\\'d the serpent, and the serpent him.\\nOne from the wound, the other from the mouth\\nBreath\\'d a thick smoke, whose vap\\'ry columns join\\'d.\\n\\nLucan in mute attention now may hear,\\nNor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus! tell,\\nNor shine, Nasidius!  Ovid now be mute.\\nWhat if in warbling fiction he record\\nCadmus and Arethusa, to a snake\\nHim chang\\'d, and her into a fountain clear,\\nI envy not; for never face to face\\nTwo natures thus transmuted did he sing,\\nWherein both shapes were ready to assume\\nThe other\\'s substance.  They in mutual guise\\nSo answer\\'d, that the serpent split his train\\nDivided to a fork, and the pierc\\'d spirit\\nDrew close his steps together, legs and thighs\\nCompacted, that no sign of juncture soon\\nWas visible: the tail disparted took\\nThe figure which the spirit lost, its skin\\nSoft\\'ning, his indurated to a rind.\\nThe shoulders next I mark\\'d, that ent\\'ring join\\'d\\nThe monster\\'s arm-pits, whose two shorter feet\\nSo lengthen\\'d, as the other\\'s dwindling shrunk.\\nThe feet behind then twisting up became\\nThat part that man conceals, which in the wretch\\nWas cleft in twain.  While both the shadowy smoke\\nWith a new colour veils, and generates\\nTh\\' excrescent pile on one, peeling it off\\nFrom th\\' other body, lo! upon his feet\\nOne upright rose, and prone the other fell.\\nNot yet their glaring and malignant lamps\\nWere shifted, though each feature chang\\'d beneath.\\nOf him who stood erect, the mounting face\\nRetreated towards the temples, and what there\\nSuperfluous matter came, shot out in ears\\nFrom the smooth cheeks, the rest, not backward dragg\\'d,\\nOf its excess did shape the nose; and swell\\'d\\nInto due size protuberant the lips.\\nHe, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends\\nHis sharpen\\'d visage, and draws down the ears\\nInto the head, as doth the slug his horns.\\nHis tongue continuous before and apt\\nFor utt\\'rance, severs; and the other\\'s fork\\nClosing unites.  That done the smoke was laid.\\nThe soul, transform\\'d into the brute, glides off,\\nHissing along the vale, and after him\\nThe other talking sputters; but soon turn\\'d\\nHis new-grown shoulders on him, and in few\\nThus to another spake: \"Along this path\\nCrawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!\"\\n\\nSo saw I fluctuate in successive change\\nTh\\' unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:\\nAnd here if aught my tongue have swerv\\'d, events\\nSo strange may be its warrant.  O\\'er mine eyes\\nConfusion hung, and on my thoughts amaze.\\n\\nYet \\'scap\\'d they not so covertly, but well\\nI mark\\'d Sciancato: he alone it was\\nOf the three first that came, who chang\\'d not: thou,\\nThe other\\'s fate, Gaville, still dost rue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXVI\\n\\nFLORENCE exult! for thou so mightily\\nHast thriven, that o\\'er land and sea thy wings\\nThou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell!\\nAmong the plund\\'rers such the three I found\\nThy citizens, whence shame to me thy son,\\nAnd no proud honour to thyself redounds.\\n\\nBut if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn,\\nAre of the truth presageful, thou ere long\\nShalt feel what Prato, (not to say the rest)\\nWould fain might come upon thee; and that chance\\nWere in good time, if it befell thee now.\\nWould so it were, since it must needs befall!\\nFor as time wears me, I shall grieve the more.\\n\\nWe from the depth departed; and my guide\\nRemounting scal\\'d the flinty steps, which late\\nWe downward trac\\'d, and drew me up the steep.\\nPursuing thus our solitary way\\nAmong the crags and splinters of the rock,\\nSped not our feet without the help of hands.\\n\\nThen sorrow seiz\\'d me, which e\\'en now revives,\\nAs my thought turns again to what I saw,\\nAnd, more than I am wont, I rein and curb\\nThe powers of nature in me, lest they run\\nWhere Virtue guides not; that if aught of good\\nMy gentle star, or something better gave me,\\nI envy not myself the precious boon.\\n\\nAs in that season, when the sun least veils\\nHis face that lightens all, what time the fly\\nGives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then\\nUpon some cliff reclin\\'d, beneath him sees\\nFire-flies innumerous spangling o\\'er the vale,\\nVineyard or tilth, where his day-labour lies:\\nWith flames so numberless throughout its space\\nShone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth\\nWas to my view expos\\'d. As he, whose wrongs\\nThe bears aveng\\'d, at its departure saw\\nElijah\\'s chariot, when the steeds erect\\nRais\\'d their steep flight for heav\\'n; his eyes meanwhile,\\nStraining pursu\\'d them, till the flame alone\\nUpsoaring like a misty speck he kenn\\'d;\\nE\\'en thus along the gulf moves every flame,\\nA sinner so enfolded close in each,\\nThat none exhibits token of the theft.\\n\\nUpon the bridge I forward bent to look,\\nAnd grasp\\'d a flinty mass, or else had fall\\'n,\\nThough push\\'d not from the height.  The guide, who mark\\'d\\nHow I did gaze attentive, thus began:\\n\\n\"Within these ardours are the spirits, each\\nSwath\\'d in confining fire.\"--\"Master, thy word,\"\\nI answer\\'d, \"hath assur\\'d me; yet I deem\\'d\\nAlready of the truth, already wish\\'d\\nTo ask thee, who is in yon fire, that comes\\nSo parted at the summit, as it seem\\'d\\nAscending from that funeral pile, where lay\\nThe Theban brothers?\"  He replied: \"Within\\nUlysses there and Diomede endure\\nTheir penal tortures, thus to vengeance now\\nTogether hasting, as erewhile to wrath.\\nThese in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore\\nThe ambush of the horse, that open\\'d wide\\nA portal for that goodly seed to pass,\\nWhich sow\\'d imperial Rome; nor less the guile\\nLament they, whence of her Achilles \\'reft\\nDeidamia yet in death complains.\\nAnd there is rued the stratagem, that Troy\\nOf her Palladium spoil\\'d.\"--\"If they have power\\nOf utt\\'rance from within these sparks,\" said I,\\n\"O master! think my prayer a thousand fold\\nIn repetition urg\\'d, that thou vouchsafe\\nTo pause, till here the horned flame arrive.\\nSee, how toward it with desire I bend.\"\\n\\nHe thus: \"Thy prayer is worthy of much praise,\\nAnd I accept it therefore: but do thou\\nThy tongue refrain: to question them be mine,\\nFor I divine thy wish: and they perchance,\\nFor they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee.\"\\n\\nWhen there the flame had come, where time and place\\nSeem\\'d fitting to my guide, he thus began:\\n\"O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!\\nIf living I of you did merit aught,\\nWhate\\'er the measure were of that desert,\\nWhen in the world my lofty strain I pour\\'d,\\nMove ye not on, till one of you unfold\\nIn what clime death o\\'ertook him self-destroy\\'d.\"\\n\\nOf the old flame forthwith the greater horn\\nBegan to roll, murmuring, as a fire\\nThat labours with the wind, then to and fro\\nWagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,\\nThrew out its voice, and spake: \"When I escap\\'d\\nFrom Circe, who beyond a circling year\\nHad held me near Caieta, by her charms,\\nEre thus Aeneas yet had nam\\'d the shore,\\nNor fondness for my son, nor reverence\\nOf my old father, nor return of love,\\nThat should have crown\\'d Penelope with joy,\\nCould overcome in me the zeal I had\\nT\\' explore the world, and search the ways of life,\\nMan\\'s evil and his virtue.  Forth I sail\\'d\\nInto the deep illimitable main,\\nWith but one bark, and the small faithful band\\nThat yet cleav\\'d to me.  As Iberia far,\\nFar as Morocco either shore I saw,\\nAnd the Sardinian and each isle beside\\nWhich round that ocean bathes.  Tardy with age\\nWere I and my companions, when we came\\nTo the strait pass, where Hercules ordain\\'d\\nThe bound\\'ries not to be o\\'erstepp\\'d by man.\\nThe walls of Seville to my right I left,\\nOn the\\' other hand already Ceuta past.\\n\\n\"O brothers!\"  I began, \"who to the west\\nThrough perils without number now have reach\\'d,\\nTo this the short remaining watch, that yet\\nOur senses have to wake, refuse not proof\\nOf the unpeopled world, following the track\\nOf Phoebus. Call to mind from whence we sprang:\\nYe were not form\\'d to live the life of brutes\\nBut virtue to pursue and knowledge high.\\nWith these few words I sharpen\\'d for the voyage\\nThe mind of my associates, that I then\\nCould scarcely have withheld them.  To the dawn\\nOur poop we turn\\'d, and for the witless flight\\nMade our oars wings, still gaining on the left.\\nEach star of the\\' other pole night now beheld,\\nAnd ours so low, that from the ocean-floor\\nIt rose not.  Five times re-illum\\'d, as oft\\nVanish\\'d the light from underneath the moon\\nSince the deep way we enter\\'d, when from far\\nAppear\\'d a mountain dim, loftiest methought\\nOf all I e\\'er beheld.  Joy seiz\\'d us straight,\\nBut soon to mourning changed.  From the new land\\nA whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side\\nDid strike the vessel.  Thrice it whirl\\'d her round\\nWith all the waves, the fourth time lifted up\\nThe poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:\\nAnd over us the booming billow clos\\'d.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XVII\\n\\nNOW upward rose the flame, and still\\'d its light\\nTo speak no more, and now pass\\'d on with leave\\nFrom the mild poet gain\\'d, when following came\\nAnother, from whose top a sound confus\\'d,\\nForth issuing, drew our eyes that way to look.\\n\\nAs the Sicilian bull, that rightfully\\nHis cries first echoed, who had shap\\'d its mould,\\nDid so rebellow, with the voice of him\\nTormented, that the brazen monster seem\\'d\\nPierc\\'d through with pain; thus while no way they found\\nNor avenue immediate through the flame,\\nInto its language turn\\'d the dismal words:\\nBut soon as they had won their passage forth,\\nUp from the point, which vibrating obey\\'d\\nTheir motion at the tongue, these sounds we heard:\\n\"O thou! to whom I now direct my voice!\\nThat lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase,\\n\\n\"Depart thou, I solicit thee no more,\\nThough somewhat tardy I perchance arrive\\nLet it not irk thee here to pause awhile,\\nAnd with me parley: lo! it irks not me\\nAnd yet I burn.  If but e\\'en now thou fall\\ninto this blind world, from that pleasant land\\nOf Latium, whence I draw my sum of guilt,\\nTell me if those, who in Romagna dwell,\\nHave peace or war.  For of the mountains there\\nWas I, betwixt Urbino and the height,\\nWhence Tyber first unlocks his mighty flood.\"\\n\\nLeaning I listen\\'d yet with heedful ear,\\nWhen, as he touch\\'d my side, the leader thus:\\n\"Speak thou: he is a Latian.\"  My reply\\nWas ready, and I spake without delay:\\n\\n\"O spirit! who art hidden here below!\\nNever was thy Romagna without war\\nIn her proud tyrants\\' bosoms, nor is now:\\nBut open war there left I none.  The state,\\nRavenna hath maintain\\'d this many a year,\\nIs steadfast.  There Polenta\\'s eagle broods,\\nAnd in his broad circumference of plume\\nO\\'ershadows Cervia.

In the world,\\nSo may thy name still rear its forehead high.\"\\n\\nThen roar\\'d awhile the fire, its sharpen\\'d point\\nOn either side wav\\'d, and thus breath\\'d at last:\\n\"If I did think, my answer were to one,\\nWho ever could return unto the world,\\nThis flame should rest unshaken.  But since ne\\'er,\\nIf true be told me, any from this depth\\nHas found his upward way, I answer thee,\\nNor fear lest infamy record the words.\\n\\n\"A man of arms at first, I cloth\\'d me then\\nIn good Saint Francis\\' girdle, hoping so\\nT\\' have made amends.

Soon as to that part\\nOf life I found me come, when each behoves\\nTo lower sails and gather in the lines;\\nThat which before had pleased me then I rued,\\nAnd to repentance and confession turn\\'d;\\nWretch that I was! and well it had bested me!\\nThe chief of the new Pharisees meantime,\\nWaging his warfare near the Lateran,\\nNot with the Saracens or Jews (his foes\\nAll Christians were, nor against Acre one\\nHad fought, nor traffic\\'d in the Soldan\\'s land),\\nHe his great charge nor sacred ministry\\nIn himself, rev\\'renc\\'d, nor in me that cord,\\nWhich us\\'d to mark with leanness whom it girded.\\nAs in Socrate, Constantine besought\\nTo cure his leprosy Sylvester\\'s aid,\\nSo me to cure the fever of his pride\\nThis man besought: my counsel to that end\\nHe ask\\'d: and I was silent: for his words\\nSeem\\'d drunken: but forthwith he thus resum\\'d:\\n\\'From thy heart banish fear: of all offence\\nI hitherto absolve thee.

No tongue\\nSo vast a theme could equal, speech and thought\\nBoth impotent alike.  If in one band\\nCollected, stood the people all, who e\\'er\\nPour\\'d on Apulia\\'s happy soil their blood,\\nSlain by the Trojans, and in that long war\\nWhen of the rings the measur\\'d booty made\\nA pile so high, as Rome\\'s historian writes\\nWho errs not, with the multitude, that felt\\nThe grinding force of Guiscard\\'s Norman steel,\\nAnd those the rest, whose bones are gather\\'d yet\\nAt Ceperano, there where treachery\\nBranded th\\' Apulian name, or where beyond\\nThy walls, O Tagliacozzo, without arms\\nThe old Alardo conquer\\'d; and his limbs\\nOne were to show transpierc\\'d, another his\\nClean lopt away; a spectacle like this\\nWere but a thing of nought, to the\\' hideous sight\\nOf the ninth chasm.  A rundlet, that hath lost\\nIts middle or side stave, gapes not so wide,\\nAs one I mark\\'d, torn from the chin throughout\\nDown to the hinder passage: \\'twixt the legs\\nDangling his entrails hung, the midriff lay\\nOpen to view, and wretched ventricle,\\nThat turns th\\' englutted aliment to dross.\\n\\nWhilst eagerly I fix on him my gaze,\\nHe ey\\'d me, with his hands laid his breast bare,\\nAnd cried; \"Now mark how I do rip me! lo!\\n\\n\"How is Mohammed mangled! before me\\nWalks Ali weeping, from the chin his face\\nCleft to the forelock; and the others all\\nWhom here thou seest, while they liv\\'d, did sow\\nScandal and schism, and therefore thus are rent.\\nA fiend is here behind, who with his sword\\nHacks us thus cruelly, slivering again\\nEach of this ream, when we have compast round\\nThe dismal way, for first our gashes close\\nEre we repass before him.

Another shade,\\nPierc\\'d in the throat, his nostrils mutilate\\nE\\'en from beneath the eyebrows, and one ear\\nLopt off, who with the rest through wonder stood\\nGazing, before the rest advanc\\'d, and bar\\'d\\nHis wind-pipe, that without was all o\\'ersmear\\'d\\nWith crimson stain.  \"O thou!\" said he, \"whom sin\\nCondemns not, and whom erst (unless too near\\nResemblance do deceive me) I aloft\\nHave seen on Latian ground, call thou to mind\\nPiero of Medicina, if again\\nReturning, thou behold\\'st the pleasant land\\nThat from Vercelli slopes to Mercabo;\\n\\n\"And there instruct the twain, whom Fano boasts\\nHer worthiest sons, Guido and Angelo,\\nThat if \\'t is giv\\'n us here to scan aright\\nThe future, they out of life\\'s tenement\\nShall be cast forth, and whelm\\'d under the waves\\nNear to Cattolica, through perfidy\\nOf a fell tyrant.  \\'Twixt the Cyprian isle\\nAnd Balearic, ne\\'er hath Neptune seen\\nAn injury so foul, by pirates done\\nOr Argive crew of old.

Then one\\nMaim\\'d of each hand, uplifted in the gloom\\nThe bleeding stumps, that they with gory spots\\nSullied his face, and cried: \"\\'Remember thee\\nOf Mosca, too, I who, alas! exclaim\\'d,\\n\\'The deed once done there is an end,\\' that prov\\'d\\nA seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race.\"\\n\\nI added: \"Ay, and death to thine own tribe.\"\\n\\nWhence heaping woe on woe he hurried off,\\nAs one grief stung to madness.  But I there\\nStill linger\\'d to behold the troop, and saw\\nThings, such as I may fear without more proof\\nTo tell of, but that conscience makes me firm,\\nThe boon companion, who her strong breast-plate\\nBuckles on him, that feels no guilt within\\nAnd bids him on and fear not.  Without doubt\\nI saw, and yet it seems to pass before me,\\nA headless trunk, that even as the rest\\nOf the sad flock pac\\'d onward.  By the hair\\nIt bore the sever\\'d member, lantern-wise\\nPendent in hand, which look\\'d at us and said,\\n\\n\"Woe\\'s me!\"  The spirit lighted thus himself,\\nAnd two there were in one, and one in two.\\nHow that may be he knows who ordereth so.\\n\\nWhen at the bridge\\'s foot direct he stood,\\nHis arm aloft he rear\\'d, thrusting the head\\nFull in our view, that nearer we might hear\\nThe words, which thus it utter\\'d: \"Now behold\\nThis grievous torment, thou, who breathing go\\'st\\nTo spy the dead; behold if any else\\nBe terrible as this.  And that on earth\\nThou mayst bear tidings of me, know that I\\nAm Bertrand, he of Born, who gave King John\\nThe counsel mischievous.  Father and son\\nI set at mutual war.

I carry from its source,\\nThat in this trunk inhabits.  Thus the law\\nOf retribution fiercely works in me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXIX\\n\\nSO were mine eyes inebriate with view\\nOf the vast multitude, whom various wounds\\nDisfigur\\'d, that they long\\'d to stay and weep.\\n\\nBut Virgil rous\\'d me: \"What yet gazest on?\\nWherefore doth fasten yet thy sight below\\nAmong the maim\\'d and miserable shades?\\nThou hast not shewn in any chasm beside\\nThis weakness.  Know, if thou wouldst number them\\nThat two and twenty miles the valley winds\\nIts circuit, and already is the moon\\nBeneath our feet: the time permitted now\\nIs short, and more not seen remains to see.\"\\n\\n\"If thou,\" I straight replied, \"hadst weigh\\'d the cause\\nFor which I look\\'d, thou hadst perchance excus\\'d\\nThe tarrying still.\"  My leader part pursu\\'d\\nHis way, the while I follow\\'d, answering him,\\nAnd adding thus: \"Within that cave I deem,\\nWhereon so fixedly I held my ken,\\nThere is a spirit dwells, one of my blood,\\nWailing the crime that costs him now so dear.\"\\n\\nThen spake my master: \"Let thy soul no more\\nAfflict itself for him.

Thou so wholly then\\nWert busied with his spirit, who once rul\\'d\\nThe towers of Hautefort, that thou lookedst not\\nThat way, ere he was gone.\"--\"O guide belov\\'d!\\nHis violent death yet unaveng\\'d,\" said I,\\n\"By any, who are partners in his shame,\\nMade him contemptuous: therefore, as I think,\\nHe pass\\'d me speechless by; and doing so\\nHath made me more compassionate his fate.\"\\n\\nSo we discours\\'d to where the rock first show\\'d\\nThe other valley, had more light been there,\\nE\\'en to the lowest depth.  Soon as we came\\nO\\'er the last cloister in the dismal rounds\\nOf Malebolge, and the brotherhood\\nWere to our view expos\\'d, then many a dart\\nOf sore lament assail\\'d me, headed all\\nWith points of thrilling pity, that I clos\\'d\\nBoth ears against the volley with mine hands.\\n\\nAs were the torment, if each lazar-house\\nOf Valdichiana, in the sultry time\\n\\'Twixt July and September, with the isle\\nSardinia and Maremma\\'s pestilent fen,\\nHad heap\\'d their maladies all in one foss\\nTogether; such was here the torment: dire\\nThe stench, as issuing steams from fester\\'d limbs.\\n\\nWe on the utmost shore of the long rock\\nDescended still to leftward.  Then my sight\\nWas livelier to explore the depth, wherein\\nThe minister of the most mighty Lord,\\nAll-searching Justice, dooms to punishment\\nThe forgers noted on her dread record.\\n\\nMore rueful was it not methinks to see\\nThe nation in Aegina droop, what time\\nEach living thing, e\\'en to the little worm,\\nAll fell, so full of malice was the air\\n(And afterward, as bards of yore have told,\\nThe ancient people were restor\\'d anew\\nFrom seed of emmets) than was here to see\\nThe spirits, that languish\\'d through the murky vale\\nUp-pil\\'d on many a stack.  Confus\\'d they lay,\\nOne o\\'er the belly, o\\'er the shoulders one\\nRoll\\'d of another; sideling crawl\\'d a third\\nAlong the dismal pathway.  Step by step\\nWe journey\\'d on, in silence looking round\\nAnd list\\'ning those diseas\\'d, who strove in vain\\nTo lift their forms.  Then two I mark\\'d, that sat\\nPropp\\'d \\'gainst each other, as two brazen pans\\nSet to retain the heat.  From head to foot,\\nA tetter bark\\'d them round. Nor saw I e\\'er\\nGroom currying so fast, for whom his lord\\nImpatient waited, or himself perchance\\nTir\\'d with long watching, as of these each one\\nPlied quickly his keen nails, through furiousness\\nOf ne\\'er abated pruriency.  The crust\\nCame drawn from underneath in flakes, like scales\\nScrap\\'d from the bream or fish of broader mail.\\n\\n\"O thou, who with thy fingers rendest off\\nThy coat of proof,\" thus spake my guide to one,\\n\"And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them,\\nTell me if any born of Latian land\\nBe among these within: so may thy nails\\nServe thee for everlasting to this toil.\"\\n\\n\"Both are of Latium,\" weeping he replied,\\n\"Whom tortur\\'d thus thou seest: but who art thou\\nThat hast inquir\\'d of us?\"  To whom my guide:\\n\"One that descend with this man, who yet lives,\\nFrom rock to rock, and show him hell\\'s abyss.\"\\n\\nThen started they asunder, and each turn\\'d\\nTrembling toward us, with the rest, whose ear\\nThose words redounding struck.  To me my liege\\nAddress\\'d him: \"Speak to them whate\\'er thou list.\"\\n\\nAnd I therewith began: \"So may no time\\nFilch your remembrance from the thoughts of men\\nIn th\\' upper world, but after many suns\\nSurvive it, as ye tell me, who ye are,\\nAnd of what race ye come.  Your punishment,\\nUnseemly and disgustful in its kind,\\nDeter you not from opening thus much to me.\"\\n\\n\"Arezzo was my dwelling,\" answer\\'d one,\\n\"And me Albero of Sienna brought\\nTo die by fire; but that, for which I died,\\nLeads me not here.

The other shape,\\nHe of Arezzo, there left trembling, spake;\\n\"That sprite of air is Schicchi; in like mood\\nOf random mischief vent he still his spite.\"\\n\\nTo whom I answ\\'ring: \"Oh! as thou dost hope,\\nThe other may not flesh its jaws on thee,\\nBe patient to inform us, who it is,\\nEre it speed hence.\"--\"That is the ancient soul\\nOf wretched Myrrha,\" he replied, \"who burn\\'d\\nWith most unholy flame for her own sire,\\n\\n\"And a false shape assuming, so perform\\'d\\nThe deed of sin; e\\'en as the other there,\\nThat onward passes, dar\\'d to counterfeit\\nDonati\\'s features, to feign\\'d testament\\nThe seal affixing, that himself might gain,\\nFor his own share, the lady of the herd.\"\\n\\nWhen vanish\\'d the two furious shades, on whom\\nMine eye was held, I turn\\'d it back to view\\nThe other cursed spirits.  One I saw\\nIn fashion like a lute, had but the groin\\nBeen sever\\'d, where it meets the forked part.\\nSwoln dropsy, disproportioning the limbs\\nWith ill-converted moisture, that the paunch\\nSuits not the visage, open\\'d wide his lips\\nGasping as in the hectic man for drought,\\nOne towards the chin, the other upward curl\\'d.\\n\\n\"O ye, who in this world of misery,\\nWherefore I know not, are exempt from pain,\"\\nThus he began, \"attentively regard\\nAdamo\\'s woe.

As a man that dreams of harm\\nBefall\\'n him, dreaming wishes it a dream,\\nAnd that which is, desires as if it were not,\\nSuch then was I, who wanting power to speak\\nWish\\'d to excuse myself, and all the while\\nExcus\\'d me, though unweeting that I did.\\n\\n\"More grievous fault than thine has been, less shame,\"\\nMy master cried, \"might expiate.  Therefore cast\\nAll sorrow from thy soul; and if again\\nChance bring thee, where like conference is held,\\nThink I am ever at thy side.  To hear\\nSuch wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXXI\\n\\nTHE very tongue, whose keen reproof before\\nHad wounded me, that either cheek was stain\\'d,\\nNow minister\\'d my cure.  So have I heard,\\nAchilles and his father\\'s javelin caus\\'d\\nPain first, and then the boon of health restor\\'d.\\n\\nTurning our back upon the vale of woe,\\nW cross\\'d th\\' encircled mound in silence.  There\\nWas twilight dim, that far long the gloom\\nMine eye advanc\\'d not: but I heard a horn\\nSounded aloud. The peal it blew had made\\nThe thunder feeble.  Following its course\\nThe adverse way, my strained eyes were bent\\nOn that one spot.  So terrible a blast\\nOrlando blew not, when that dismal rout\\nO\\'erthrew the host of Charlemagne, and quench\\'d\\nHis saintly warfare.  Thitherward not long\\nMy head was rais\\'d, when many lofty towers\\nMethought I spied.  \"Master,\" said I, \"what land\\nIs this?\"  He answer\\'d straight: \"Too long a space\\nOf intervening darkness has thine eye\\nTo traverse: thou hast therefore widely err\\'d\\nIn thy imagining.  Thither arriv\\'d\\nThou well shalt see, how distance can delude\\nThe sense.  A little therefore urge thee on.\"\\n\\nThen tenderly he caught me by the hand;\\n\"Yet know,\" said he, \"ere farther we advance,\\nThat it less strange may seem, these are not towers,\\nBut giants.  In the pit they stand immers\\'d,\\nEach from his navel downward, round the bank.\"\\n\\nAs when a fog disperseth gradually,\\nOur vision traces what the mist involves\\nCondens\\'d in air; so piercing through the gross\\nAnd gloomy atmosphere, as more and more\\nWe near\\'d toward the brink, mine error fled,\\nAnd fear came o\\'er me.  As with circling round\\nOf turrets, Montereggion crowns his walls,\\nE\\'en thus the shore, encompassing th\\' abyss,\\nWas turreted with giants, half their length\\nUprearing, horrible, whom Jove from heav\\'n\\nYet threatens, when his mutt\\'ring thunder rolls.\\n\\nOf one already I descried the face,\\nShoulders, and breast, and of the belly huge\\nGreat part, and both arms down along his ribs.\\n\\nAll-teeming nature, when her plastic hand\\nLeft framing of these monsters, did display\\nPast doubt her wisdom, taking from mad War\\nSuch slaves to do his bidding; and if she\\nRepent her not of th\\' elephant and whale,\\nWho ponders well confesses her therein\\nWiser and more discreet; for when brute force\\nAnd evil will are back\\'d with subtlety,\\nResistance none avails.  His visage seem\\'d\\nIn length and bulk, as doth the pine, that tops\\nSaint Peter\\'s Roman fane; and th\\' other bones\\nOf like proportion, so that from above\\nThe bank, which girdled him below, such height\\nArose his stature, that three Friezelanders\\nHad striv\\'n in vain to reach but to his hair.\\nFull thirty ample palms was he expos\\'d\\nDownward from whence a man his garments loops.\\n\"Raphel bai ameth sabi almi,\"\\nSo shouted his fierce lips, which sweeter hymns\\nBecame not; and my guide address\\'d him thus:\\n\\n\"O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee\\nInterpret: therewith vent thy rage, if rage\\nOr other passion wring thee.  Search thy neck,\\nThere shalt thou find the belt that binds it on.\\nWild spirit! lo, upon thy mighty breast\\nWhere hangs the baldrick!\"  Then to me he spake:\\n\"He doth accuse himself.  Nimrod is this,\\nThrough whose ill counsel in the world no more\\nOne tongue prevails.  But pass we on, nor waste\\nOur words; for so each language is to him,\\nAs his to others, understood by none.\"\\n\\nThen to the leftward turning sped we forth,\\nAnd at a sling\\'s throw found another shade\\nFar fiercer and more huge.  I cannot say\\nWhat master hand had girt him; but he held\\nBehind the right arm fetter\\'d, and before\\nThe other with a chain, that fasten\\'d him\\nFrom the neck down, and five times round his form\\nApparent met the wreathed links.  \"This proud one\\nWould of his strength against almighty Jove\\nMake trial,\" said my guide; \"whence he is thus\\nRequited: Ephialtes him they call.\\n\\n\"Great was his prowess, when the giants brought\\nFear on the gods: those arms, which then he piled,\\nNow moves he never.\"  Forthwith I return\\'d:\\n\"Fain would I, if \\'t were possible, mine eyes\\nOf Briareus immeasurable gain\\'d\\nExperience next.\"  He answer\\'d: \"Thou shalt see\\nNot far from hence Antaeus, who both speaks\\nAnd is unfetter\\'d, who shall place us there\\nWhere guilt is at its depth.  Far onward stands\\nWhom thou wouldst fain behold, in chains, and made\\nLike to this spirit, save that in his looks\\nMore fell he seems.\"  By violent earthquake rock\\'d\\nNe\\'er shook a tow\\'r, so reeling to its base,\\nAs Ephialtes.  More than ever then\\nI dreaded death, nor than the terror more\\nHad needed, if I had not seen the cords\\nThat held him fast.  We, straightway journeying on,\\nCame to Antaeus, who five ells complete\\nWithout the head, forth issued from the cave.\\n\\n\"O thou, who in the fortunate vale, that made\\nGreat Scipio heir of glory, when his sword\\nDrove back the troop of Hannibal in flight,\\nWho thence of old didst carry for thy spoil\\nAn hundred lions; and if thou hadst fought\\nIn the high conflict on thy brethren\\'s side,\\nSeems as men yet believ\\'d, that through thine arm\\nThe sons of earth had conquer\\'d, now vouchsafe\\nTo place us down beneath, where numbing cold\\nLocks up Cocytus.  Force not that we crave\\nOr Tityus\\' help or Typhon\\'s.  Here is one\\nCan give what in this realm ye covet.  Stoop\\nTherefore, nor scornfully distort thy lip.\\nHe in the upper world can yet bestow\\nRenown on thee, for he doth live, and looks\\nFor life yet longer, if before the time\\nGrace call him not unto herself.\"  Thus spake\\nThe teacher.  He in haste forth stretch\\'d his hands,\\nAnd caught my guide.  Alcides whilom felt\\nThat grapple straighten\\'d score.  Soon as my guide\\nHad felt it, he bespake me thus: \"This way\\nThat I may clasp thee;\" then so caught me up,\\nThat we were both one burden.  As appears\\nThe tower of Carisenda, from beneath\\nWhere it doth lean, if chance a passing cloud\\nSo sail across, that opposite it hangs,\\nSuch then Antaeus seem\\'d, as at mine ease\\nI mark\\'d him stooping.  I were fain at times\\nT\\' have pass\\'d another way.  Yet in th\\' abyss,\\nThat Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs,\\nLightly he plac\\'d us; nor there leaning stay\\'d,\\nBut rose as in a bark the stately mast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXXII\\n\\nCOULD I command rough rhimes and hoarse, to suit\\nThat hole of sorrow, o\\'er which ev\\'ry rock\\nHis firm abutment rears, then might the vein\\nOf fancy rise full springing: but not mine\\nSuch measures, and with falt\\'ring awe I touch\\nThe mighty theme; for to describe the depth\\nOf all the universe, is no emprize\\nTo jest with, and demands a tongue not us\\'d\\nTo infant babbling.  But let them assist\\nMy song, the tuneful maidens, by whose aid\\nAmphion wall\\'d in Thebes, so with the truth\\nMy speech shall best accord.  Oh ill-starr\\'d folk,\\nBeyond all others wretched! who abide\\nIn such a mansion, as scarce thought finds words\\nTo speak of, better had ye here on earth\\nBeen flocks or mountain goats.  As down we stood\\nIn the dark pit beneath the giants\\' feet,\\nBut lower far than they, and I did gaze\\nStill on the lofty battlement, a voice\\nBespoke me thus: \"Look how thou walkest.  Take\\nGood heed, thy soles do tread not on the heads\\nOf thy poor brethren.\"  Thereupon I turn\\'d,\\nAnd saw before and underneath my feet\\nA lake, whose frozen surface liker seem\\'d\\nTo glass than water.  Not so thick a veil\\nIn winter e\\'er hath Austrian Danube spread\\nO\\'er his still course, nor Tanais far remote\\nUnder the chilling sky.  Roll\\'d o\\'er that mass\\nHad Tabernich or Pietrapana fall\\'n,\\n\\nNot e\\'en its rim had creak\\'d. As peeps the frog\\nCroaking above the wave, what time in dreams\\nThe village gleaner oft pursues her toil,\\nSo, to where modest shame appears, thus low\\nBlue pinch\\'d and shrin\\'d in ice the spirits stood,\\nMoving their teeth in shrill note like the stork.\\nHis face each downward held; their mouth the cold,\\nTheir eyes express\\'d the dolour of their heart.\\n\\nA space I look\\'d around, then at my feet\\nSaw two so strictly join\\'d, that of their head\\nThe very hairs were mingled.  \"Tell me ye,\\nWhose bosoms thus together press,\" said I,\\n\"Who are ye?\"  At that sound their necks they bent,\\nAnd when their looks were lifted up to me,\\nStraightway their eyes, before all moist within,\\nDistill\\'d upon their lips, and the frost bound\\nThe tears betwixt those orbs and held them there.\\nPlank unto plank hath never cramp clos\\'d up\\nSo stoutly.  Whence like two enraged goats\\nThey clash\\'d together; them such fury seiz\\'d.\\n\\nAnd one, from whom the cold both ears had reft,\\nExclaim\\'d, still looking downward: \"Why on us\\nDost speculate so long?  If thou wouldst know\\nWho are these two, the valley, whence his wave\\nBisenzio slopes, did for its master own\\nTheir sire Alberto, and next him themselves.\\nThey from one body issued; and throughout\\nCaina thou mayst search, nor find a shade\\nMore worthy in congealment to be fix\\'d,\\nNot him, whose breast and shadow Arthur\\'s land\\nAt that one blow dissever\\'d, not Focaccia,\\nNo not this spirit, whose o\\'erjutting head\\nObstructs my onward view: he bore the name\\nOf Mascheroni: Tuscan if thou be,\\nWell knowest who he was: and to cut short\\nAll further question, in my form behold\\nWhat once was Camiccione.  I await\\nCarlino here my kinsman, whose deep guilt\\nShall wash out mine.\"  A thousand visages\\nThen mark\\'d I, which the keen and eager cold\\nHad shap\\'d into a doggish grin; whence creeps\\nA shiv\\'ring horror o\\'er me, at the thought\\nOf those frore shallows.  While we journey\\'d on\\nToward the middle, at whose point unites\\nAll heavy substance, and I trembling went\\nThrough that eternal chillness, I know not\\nIf will it were or destiny, or chance,\\nBut, passing \\'midst the heads, my foot did strike\\nWith violent blow against the face of one.\\n\\n\"Wherefore dost bruise me?\" weeping, he exclaim\\'d,\\n\"Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge\\nFor Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?\"\\n\\nI thus: \"Instructor, now await me here,\\nThat I through him may rid me of my doubt.\\nThenceforth what haste thou wilt.\"  The teacher paus\\'d,\\nAnd to that shade I spake, who bitterly\\nStill curs\\'d me in his wrath.  \"What art thou, speak,\\nThat railest thus on others?\"  He replied:\\n\"Now who art thou, that smiting others\\' cheeks\\nThrough Antenora roamest, with such force\\nAs were past suff\\'rance, wert thou living still?\"\\n\\n\"And I am living, to thy joy perchance,\"\\nWas my reply, \"if fame be dear to thee,\\nThat with the rest I may thy name enrol.\"\\n\\n\"The contrary of what I covet most,\"\\nSaid he, \"thou tender\\'st: hence; nor vex me more.\\nIll knowest thou to flatter in this vale.\"\\n\\nThen seizing on his hinder scalp, I cried:\\n\"Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here.\"\\n\\n\"Rend all away,\" he answer\\'d, \"yet for that\\nI will not tell nor show thee who I am,\\nThough at my head thou pluck a thousand times.\"\\n\\nNow I had grasp\\'d his tresses, and stript off\\nMore than one tuft, he barking, with his eyes\\nDrawn in and downward, when another cried,\\n\"What ails thee, Bocca?

Farther on,\\nIf I misdeem not, Soldanieri bides,\\nWith Ganellon, and Tribaldello, him\\nWho op\\'d Faenza when the people slept.\"\\n\\nWe now had left him, passing on our way,\\nWhen I beheld two spirits by the ice\\nPent in one hollow, that the head of one\\nWas cowl unto the other; and as bread\\nIs raven\\'d up through hunger, th\\' uppermost\\nDid so apply his fangs to th\\' other\\'s brain,\\nWhere the spine joins it.  Not more furiously\\nOn Menalippus\\' temples Tydeus gnaw\\'d,\\nThan on that skull and on its garbage he.\\n\\n\"O thou who show\\'st so beastly sign of hate\\n\\'Gainst him thou prey\\'st on, let me hear,\" said I\\n\"The cause, on such condition, that if right\\nWarrant thy grievance, knowing who ye are,\\nAnd what the colour of his sinning was,\\nI may repay thee in the world above,\\nIf that, wherewith I speak be moist so long.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXXIII\\n\\nHIS jaws uplifting from their fell repast,\\nThat sinner wip\\'d them on the hairs o\\' th\\' head,\\nWhich he behind had mangled, then began:\\n\"Thy will obeying, I call up afresh\\nSorrow past cure, which but to think of wrings\\nMy heart, or ere I tell on\\'t.

When I awoke\\nBefore the dawn, amid their sleep I heard\\nMy sons (for they were with me) weep and ask\\nFor bread.  Right cruel art thou, if no pang\\nThou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;\\nAnd if not now, why use thy tears to flow?\\nNow had they waken\\'d; and the hour drew near\\nWhen they were wont to bring us food; the mind\\nOf each misgave him through his dream, and I\\nHeard, at its outlet underneath lock\\'d up\\nThe\\' horrible tower: whence uttering not a word\\nI look\\'d upon the visage of my sons.\\nI wept not: so all stone I felt within.\\nThey wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:\\n\"Thou lookest so!  Father what ails thee?\"  Yet\\nI shed no tear, nor answer\\'d all that day\\nNor the next night, until another sun\\nCame out upon the world.  When a faint beam\\nHad to our doleful prison made its way,\\nAnd in four countenances I descry\\'d\\nThe image of my own, on either hand\\nThrough agony I bit, and they who thought\\nI did it through desire of feeding, rose\\nO\\' th\\' sudden, and cried, \\'Father, we should grieve\\nFar less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav\\'st\\nThese weeds of miserable flesh we wear,\\n\\n\\'And do thou strip them off from us again.\\'\\nThen, not to make them sadder, I kept down\\nMy spirit in stillness.  That day and the next\\nWe all were silent.  Ah, obdurate earth!\\nWhy open\\'dst not upon us?  When we came\\nTo the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet\\nOutstretch\\'d did fling him, crying, \\'Hast no help\\nFor me, my father!\\'  There he died, and e\\'en\\nPlainly as thou seest me, saw I the three\\nFall one by one \\'twixt the fifth day and sixth:\\n\\n\"Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope\\nOver them all, and for three days aloud\\nCall\\'d on them who were dead.  Then fasting got\\nThe mastery of grief.\"  Thus having spoke,\\n\\nOnce more upon the wretched skull his teeth\\nHe fasten\\'d, like a mastiff\\'s \\'gainst the bone\\nFirm and unyielding.  Oh thou Pisa! shame\\nOf all the people, who their dwelling make\\nIn that fair region, where th\\' Italian voice\\nIs heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack\\nTo punish, from their deep foundations rise\\nCapraia and Gorgona, and dam up\\nThe mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee\\nMay perish in the waters!  What if fame\\nReported that thy castles were betray\\'d\\nBy Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou\\nTo stretch his children on the rack.  For them,\\nBrigata, Ugaccione, and the pair\\nOf gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,\\nTheir tender years, thou modern Thebes! did make\\nUncapable of guilt.  Onward we pass\\'d,\\nWhere others skarf\\'d in rugged folds of ice\\nNot on their feet were turn\\'d, but each revers\\'d.\\n\\nThere very weeping suffers not to weep;\\nFor at their eyes grief seeking passage finds\\nImpediment, and rolling inward turns\\nFor increase of sharp anguish: the first tears\\nHang cluster\\'d, and like crystal vizors show,\\nUnder the socket brimming all the cup.\\n\\nNow though the cold had from my face dislodg\\'d\\nEach feeling, as \\'t were callous, yet me seem\\'d\\nSome breath of wind I felt.  \"Whence cometh this,\"\\nSaid I, \"my master?  Is not here below\\nAll vapour quench\\'d?\"--\"\\'Thou shalt be speedily,\"\\nHe answer\\'d, \"where thine eye shall tell thee whence\\nThe cause descrying of this airy shower.\"\\n\\nThen cried out one in the chill crust who mourn\\'d:\\n\"O souls so cruel! that the farthest post\\nHath been assign\\'d you, from this face remove\\nThe harden\\'d veil, that I may vent the grief\\nImpregnate at my heart, some little space\\nEre it congeal again!\"  I thus replied:\\n\"Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;\\nAnd if I extricate thee not, far down\\nAs to the lowest ice may I descend!\"\\n\\n\"The friar Alberigo,\" answered he,\\n\"Am I, who from the evil garden pluck\\'d\\nIts fruitage, and am here repaid, the date\\nMore luscious for my fig.\"--\"Hah!\"  I exclaim\\'d,\\n\"Art thou too dead!\"--\"How in the world aloft\\nIt fareth with my body,\" answer\\'d he,\\n\"I am right ignorant.  Such privilege\\nHath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul\\nDrops hither, ere by Atropos divorc\\'d.\\nAnd that thou mayst wipe out more willingly\\nThe glazed tear-drops that o\\'erlay mine eyes,\\nKnow that the soul, that moment she betrays,\\nAs I did, yields her body to a fiend\\nWho after moves and governs it at will,\\nTill all its time be rounded; headlong she\\nFalls to this cistern.  And perchance above\\nDoth yet appear the body of a ghost,\\nWho here behind me winters.  Him thou know\\'st,\\nIf thou but newly art arriv\\'d below.\\nThe years are many that have pass\\'d away,\\nSince to this fastness Branca Doria came.\"\\n\\n\"Now,\" answer\\'d I, \"methinks thou mockest me,\\nFor Branca Doria never yet hath died,\\nBut doth all natural functions of a man,\\nEats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on.\"\\n\\nHe thus: \"Not yet unto that upper foss\\nBy th\\' evil talons guarded, where the pitch\\nTenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach\\'d,\\nWhen this one left a demon in his stead\\nIn his own body, and of one his kin,\\nWho with him treachery wrought.  But now put forth\\nThy hand, and ope mine eyes.\"  I op\\'d them not.\\nIll manners were best courtesy to him.\\n\\nAh Genoese! men perverse in every way,\\nWith every foulness stain\\'d, why from the earth\\nAre ye not cancel\\'d?  Such an one of yours\\nI with Romagna\\'s darkest spirit found,\\nAs for his doings even now in soul\\nIs in Cocytus plung\\'d, and yet doth seem\\nIn body still alive upon the earth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANTO XXXIV\\n\\n\"THE banners of Hell\\'s Monarch do come forth\\nTowards us; therefore look,\" so spake my guide,\\n\"If thou discern him.\"  As, when breathes a cloud\\nHeavy and dense, or when the shades of night\\nFall on our hemisphere, seems view\\'d from far\\nA windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,\\nSuch was the fabric then methought I saw,\\n\\nTo shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew\\nBehind my guide: no covert else was there.\\n\\nNow came I (and with fear I bid my strain\\nRecord the marvel) where the souls were all\\nWhelm\\'d underneath, transparent, as through glass\\nPellucid the frail stem.  Some prone were laid,\\nOthers stood upright, this upon the soles,\\nThat on his head, a third with face to feet\\nArch\\'d like a bow.  When to the point we came,\\nWhereat my guide was pleas\\'d that I should see\\nThe creature eminent in beauty once,\\nHe from before me stepp\\'d and made me pause.\\n\\n\"Lo!\"  he exclaim\\'d, \"lo Dis! and lo the place,\\nWhere thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength.\"\\n\\nHow frozen and how faint I then became,\\nAsk me not, reader! for I write it not,\\nSince words would fail to tell thee of my state.\\nI was not dead nor living.  Think thyself\\nIf quick conception work in thee at all,\\nHow I did feel.  That emperor, who sways\\nThe realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th\\' ice\\nStood forth; and I in stature am more like\\nA giant, than the giants are in his arms.\\nMark now how great that whole must be, which suits\\nWith such a part.  If he were beautiful\\nAs he is hideous now, and yet did dare\\nTo scowl upon his Maker, well from him\\nMay all our mis\\'ry flow.  Oh what a sight!\\nHow passing strange it seem\\'d, when I did spy\\nUpon his head three faces: one in front\\nOf hue vermilion, th\\' other two with this\\nMidway each shoulder join\\'d and at the crest;\\nThe right \\'twixt wan and yellow seem\\'d: the left\\nTo look on, such as come from whence old Nile\\nStoops to the lowlands.  Under each shot forth\\nTwo mighty wings, enormous as became\\nA bird so vast.  Sails never such I saw\\nOutstretch\\'d on the wide sea.  No plumes had they,\\nBut were in texture like a bat, and these\\nHe flapp\\'d i\\' th\\' air, that from him issued still\\nThree winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth\\nWas frozen.  At six eyes he wept: the tears\\nAdown three chins distill\\'d with bloody foam.\\nAt every mouth his teeth a sinner champ\\'d\\nBruis\\'d as with pond\\'rous engine, so that three\\nWere in this guise tormented.  But far more\\nThan from that gnawing, was the foremost pang\\'d\\nBy the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back\\nWas stript of all its skin.  \"That upper spirit,\\nWho hath worse punishment,\" so spake my guide,\\n\"Is Judas, he that hath his head within\\nAnd plies the feet without.  Of th\\' other two,\\nWhose heads are under, from the murky jaw\\nWho hangs, is Brutus: lo! how he doth writhe\\nAnd speaks not!  Th\\' other Cassius, that appears\\nSo large of limb.  But night now re-ascends,\\nAnd it is time for parting.  All is seen.\"\\n\\nI clipp\\'d him round the neck, for so he bade;\\nAnd noting time and place, he, when the wings\\nEnough were op\\'d, caught fast the shaggy sides,\\nAnd down from pile to pile descending stepp\\'d\\nBetween the thick fell and the jagged ice.\\n\\nSoon as he reach\\'d the point, whereat the thigh\\nUpon the swelling of the haunches turns,\\nMy leader there with pain and struggling hard\\nTurn\\'d round his head, where his feet stood before,\\nAnd grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,\\nThat into hell methought we turn\\'d again.\\n\\n\"Expect that by such stairs as these,\" thus spake\\nThe teacher, panting like a man forespent,\\n\"We must depart from evil so extreme.\"\\nThen at a rocky opening issued forth,\\nAnd plac\\'d me on a brink to sit, next join\\'d\\nWith wary step my side.  I rais\\'d mine eyes,\\nBelieving that I Lucifer should see\\nWhere he was lately left, but saw him now\\nWith legs held upward.  Let the grosser sort,\\nWho see not what the point was I had pass\\'d,\\nBethink them if sore toil oppress\\'d me then.\\n\\n\"Arise,\" my master cried, \"upon thy feet.\\nThe way is long, and much uncouth the road;\\nAnd now within one hour and half of noon\\nThe sun returns.\"  It was no palace-hall\\nLofty and luminous wherein we stood,\\nBut natural dungeon where ill footing was\\nAnd scant supply of light.  \"Ere from th\\' abyss\\nI sep\\'rate,\" thus when risen I began,\\n\"My guide! vouchsafe few words to set me free\\nFrom error\\'s thralldom.  Where is now the ice?\\nHow standeth he in posture thus revers\\'d?\\nAnd how from eve to morn in space so brief\\nHath the sun made his transit?\"  He in few\\nThus answering spake: \"Thou deemest thou art still\\nOn th\\' other side the centre, where I grasp\\'d\\nTh\\' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.\\nThou wast on th\\' other side, so long as I\\nDescended; when I turn\\'d, thou didst o\\'erpass\\nThat point, to which from ev\\'ry part is dragg\\'d\\nAll heavy substance.  Thou art now arriv\\'d\\nUnder the hemisphere opposed to that,\\nWhich the great continent doth overspread,\\nAnd underneath whose canopy expir\\'d\\nThe Man, that was born sinless, and so liv\\'d.\\nThy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,\\nWhose other aspect is Judecca.  Morn\\nHere rises, when there evening sets: and he,\\nWhose shaggy pile was scal\\'d, yet standeth fix\\'d,\\nAs at the first.  On this part he fell down\\nFrom heav\\'n; and th\\' earth, here prominent before,\\nThrough fear of him did veil her with the sea,\\nAnd to our hemisphere retir\\'d.  Perchance\\nTo shun him was the vacant space left here\\nBy what of firm land on this side appears,\\nThat sprang aloof.\"  There is a place beneath,\\nFrom Belzebub as distant, as extends\\nThe vaulted tomb, discover\\'d not by sight,\\nBut by the sound of brooklet, that descends\\nThis way along the hollow of a rock,\\nWhich, as it winds with no precipitous course,\\nThe wave hath eaten.  By that hidden way\\nMy guide and I did enter, to return\\nTo the fair world: and heedless of repose\\nWe climbed, he first, I following his steps,\\nTill on our view the beautiful lights of heav\\'n\\nDawn\\'d through a circular opening in the cave:\\nThus issuing we again beheld the stars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s The Divine Comedy, Complete, by Dante Alighieri\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DIVINE COMEDY, COMPLETE ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 8800.txt or 8800.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/8/8/0/8800/\\n\\nProduced by David Widger\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.
